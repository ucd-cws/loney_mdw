  abstract  = "Abstract The Foothill Yellow-Legged Frog (Rana boylii) is a
               threatened river-dwelling amphibian endemic to California and
               Oregon. Determining the genetic structure of populations that
               have not yet declined is an important tool for their
               conservation. In this study, molecular markers were used to
               asses the genetic structure of R. boylii. The ND2 region of the
               mitochondrial genome and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
               markers were examined amongst 51 individuals collected from
               seven relatively pristine tributaries branching off the Eel
               River in Northern California. Both markers exhibited significant
               genetic differentiation among tributaries; however, the RAPD
               markers revealed a positive correlation between geographic
               distance and genetic distance. Cluster analysis illustrated a
               distinct separation between northern and southern tributaries
               within the study site. In contrast, relatively little geographic
               structure was apparent when mtDNA haplotypes were examined.
               Discordance may be caused by the number of loci examined in the
               mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, recent divergence, and
               sex-biased dispersal.",

              Developmental response to habitat desiccation in tadpoles of
              Scaphiopus hammondii",
  author   = "Denver, R J and Mirhadi, N and Phillips - Ecology, M and {1998}",
  abstract = "Amphibians exhibit extreme plasticity in the timing of
              metamorphosis, and several species have been shown to respond to
              water availability, accelerating metamorphosis when their ponds
              dry. In this study we analyzed the plasticity of the
              developmental response to water volume reduction in the western
              spadefoot toad, Scaphiopus hammondii. Also, we attempted to
              identify the environmental cue(s) that may signal a desiccating
              larval habitat. We spawned adults in the laboratory and raised
              tadpoles in aquaria in a controlled environmental chamber. Water
              levels of aquaria were gradually reduced by removing water at the
              rate of 0.5-1 L/d; water in control aquaria was similarly
              disturbed but not removed. Tadpoles subjected to water volume
              reduction showed significant acceleration of metamorphosis. The
              developmental acceleration depended on the rate of reduction of
              the water level; i.e., tadpoles exhibited a continuum of
              response. This developmental response did not result from thermal
              differences between treatments. Furthermore, the response was
              reversible in that refilling of the aquaria to the starting water
              level at various times following the onset of volume reduction
              resulted in restoration of body mass and a tendency to decelerate
              metamorphosis. Several lines of evidence suggest that the
              developmental response is due neither to the concentration of
              compounds in the water nor to chemical or physical interactions
              among conspecifics. Rather, the response appears to be related to
              the reduced swimming volume and perhaps the proximity to the
              water surface. When the water level is reduced, tadpoles reduce
              foraging, and food restriction of prometamorphic tadpoles
              maintained in a constant high water environment accelerated
              metamorphosis. Spadefoot toad tadpoles are a valuable model
              system for explaining both the proximate mechanisms
              (environmental cues and physiological responses) and the ultimate
              causes for adaptive phenotypic plasticity in amphibian
              metamorphosis.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACT. Benthic macroinvertebrates are integral components of
               stream ecosystems and are often used to assess the ecological
               integrity of streams. We sampled streams in the upper Clear
               Creek drainage in the Klamath?Siskiyou Ecoregion of northwestern
               California in fall 2004 (17 sites) and 2005 (original 17 plus 4
               new sites) with the objectives of documenting the benthic
               macroinvertebrate assemblages supported by the streams in the
               area, determining how those assemblages respond to environmental
               variables, assessing the biological condition of the streams
               using a benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI), and
               understanding the assemblages in the context of biodiversity of
               the ecoregion. We collected both reach-wide (RW) and
               targeted-riffle (TR) macroinvertebrate samples at each site. The
               macroinvertebrate assemblages were diverse, with over 150 genera
               collected for each sampling protocol. The macroinvertebrate
               assemblages appeared to be most responsive to a general habitat
               gradient based on stream size, gradient, flow, and dominance of
               riffles. A second important habitat gradient was based on
               elevation and dominance of riffles. A gradient in water quality
               based on concentrations of dissolved ions and metals was also
               important. Models based on these 3 gradients had Spearman's rank
               correlations with macroinvertebrate taxonomic composition of
               0.60 and 0.50 for the TR and RW samples, respectively. The
               majority (>50\%) of the sites were in good or very good
               biological condition based on IBI scores. The diversity of
               macroinvertebrate assemblages is associated with the diversity
               of habitats available in the Klamath?Siskiyou Ecoregion.
               Maintaining the aquatic habitats in good condition is important
               in itself but is also vital to maintaining biodiversity in this
               diverse and unique ecoregion.",

  author   = "Knapp, R A and Matthews, K R",
  abstract = "One of the most puzzling aspects of the worldwide decline of
              amphibians is their disappearance from within protected areas.
              Because these areas are ostensibly undisturbed, habitat
              alterations are generally perceived as unlikely causes. The
              introduction of non-native fishes into protected areas, however,
              is a common practice throughout the world and may exert an
              important influence on amphibian distributions. We quantified the
              role of introduced fishes (several species of trout) in the
              decline of the mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) in
              California's Sierra Nevada through surveys of >1700 sites in two
              adjacent and historically fishless protected areas that differed
              primarily in the distribution of introduced fish. Negative
              effects of fishes on the distribution of frogs were evident at
              three spatial scales. At the landscape scale, comparisons between
              the two protected areas indicated that fish distribution was
              strongly negatively correlated with the distribution of frogs. At
              the watershed scale, the percentage of total water-body surface
              area occupied by fishes was a highly significant predictor of the
              percentage of total water-body surface area occupied by frogs. At
              the scale of individual water bodies, frogs were three times more
              likely to be found and six times more abundant in fishless than
              in fish-containing waterbodies, after habitat effects were
              accounted for. The strong effect of introduced fishes on mountain
              yellow-legged frogs appears to result from the unique life
              history of this amphibian which frequently restricts larvae to
              deeper water bodies, the same habitats into which fishes have
              most frequently been introduced. Because fish populations in at
              least some Sierra Nevada lakes can be removed with minimal
              effort, our results suggest that the decline of the mountain

              after restoration of a peatland formerly mined for peat. We
              assessed whether bog pools created during restoration are similar
              to natural bog pools in terms of water chemistry, vegetation
              structure and composition, as well as amphibian and arthropod
              occurrence patterns. 2. Both avian species richness and peatland
              vegetation cover at the site increased following restoration.
              Within bog pools, however, the vegetation composition differed
              between natural and man-made pools. The cover of low shrubs,
              Sphagnum moss, submerged, emergent and floating vegetation in
              man-made pools was lower than in natural pools, whereas pH was
              higher than in typical bog pools. Dominant plant species also
              differed between man-made and natural pools. 3. Amphibian
              tadpoles, juveniles and adults occurred more often in man-made
              pools than natural bog pools. Although some arthropods, including
              Coleoptera bog specialists, readily colonised the pools, their
              abundance was two to 26 times lower than in natural bog pools.
              Plant introduction in bog pools, at the stocking densities we
              applied, had no effect on the occurrence of most groups. 4. We

              those of natural peatlands, but 4 years were not sufficient for

              (between-site) characteristics; and (c) wetland connectivity
              metrics using a unique methodology. Specifically, we developed
              three networks that quantify wetland connectivity based on: (i)
              P. maculata dispersal ability, (ii) temporal variation in wetland
              quality, and (iii) contribution of wetland stepping-stones to
              frog dispersal. We examined 18 wetlands in Colorado, and
              quantified 12 microsatellite loci from 322 individual frogs. We
              found that genetic connectivity was related to topographic
              complexity, within- and between-wetland differences in moisture,
              and wetland functional connectivity as contributed by
              stepping-stone wetlands. Our results highlight the role that
              dynamic environmental factors have on dispersal-limited species
              and illustrate how complex asynchronous interactions contribute
              to the structure of spatially-explicit metapopulations.",

              observations demonstrated apparent connections between spinal
              nerve endings and epithelial cells of the skin and we used neural
              and behavioral responses as measures of coupling between
              transport and chemosensation. The inhibition of transcellular Na+
              transport by amiloride partially reduced the neural response and
              the avoidance of hyperosmotic NaCl but not KCl solutions.
              Cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) reduced the neural response to
              hyperosmotic salt solutions, suggesting a chemosensory role for
              vanilloid receptors in the skin. Avoidance of hyperosmotic salt
              solutions was reduced by impermeant anions suggesting
              paracellular conductance is important for chemosensation. The
              effects of blocking the transcellular and paracellular pathways
              was additive but did not eliminate the avoidance of osmotically
              unfavorable solutions by dehydrated toads. The timing of the
              neural response to deionized water was similar to the onset of
              water absorption behavior and increased blood flow to the pelvic
              skin. Water absorption from 50 mM NaCl was greater than from
              deionized water when toads were fully immersed, but not when

              LocationBritish Columbia, Canada. MethodsWe estimated the risk
              from climate change for three high-latitude amphibian species
              (Spea intermontana, Rana aurora and Pseudacris regilla) by
              combining thermal performance experiments with species
              distribution models and predicted changes in maximum summer
              temperatures through the 2080s, in order to demonstrate temporal
              and geographical trends in vulnerability to climate warming among
              and within species. ResultsWe found that species have thermal
              safety margins of 3.2-3.8 degrees C based on current maximum
              summer temperatures. However, by the 2080s (emissions scenario
              A1B), we estimate that 45-82\% of our focal species' current
              distributions will experience maximum summer temperatures above
              their thermal optima. We also found that by using long-term
              average temperatures, as some studies have done, there were
              almost no scenarios in which populations of any species were
              experiencing temperatures greater than their thermal optima. Main
              conclusionsCombining spatially explicit species distribution
              models with performance physiology allows us to predict where
              limiting temperatures will occur in the coming decades, and can
              guide climate mitigation and conservation efforts before
              populations decline. Despite moderate thermal safety margins,
              high-latitude ectotherms can be highly vulnerable to climate

              estimates of risk as a result of climate change.",

              in introduction pathways and climatic similarity between the
              native range and introduction locality, with minor contributions

  abstract = "A large number of factors are known to affect amphibian
              population viability, but most authors agree that the principal
              causes of amphibian declines are habitat loss, alteration, and
              fragmentation. We provide a global assessment of land use
              dynamics in the context of amphibian distributions. We
              accomplished this by compiling global maps of amphibian species
              richness and recent rates of change in land cover, land use, and
              human population growth. The amphibian map was developed using a
              combination of published literature and digital databases. We
              used an ecoregion framework to help interpret species
              distributions across environmental, rather than political,
              boundaries. We mapped rates of land cover and use change with
              statistics from the World Resources Institute, refined with a
              global digital dataset on land cover derived from satellite data.
              Temporal maps of human population were developed from the World
              Resources Institute database and other published sources. Our
              resultant map of amphibian species richness illustrates that
              amphibians are distributed in an uneven pattern around the globe,
              preferring terrestrial and freshwater habitats in ecoregions that
              are warm and moist. Spatiotemporal patterns of human population
              show that, prior to the 20(th) century, population growth and
              spread was slower, most extensive in the temperate ecoregions,
              and largely exclusive of major regions of high amphibian
              richness. Since the beginning of the 20(th) century, human
              population growth has been exponential and has occurred largely
              in the subtropical and tropical ecoregions favored by amphibians.
              Population growth has been accompanied by broad-scale changes in
              land cover and land use, typically in support of agriculture. We
              merged information on land cover, land use, and human population
              growth to generate a composite map showing the rates at which
              humans have been changing the world. When compared with the map
              of amphibian species richness, we found that many of the regions
              of the earth supporting the richest assemblages of amphibians are
              currently undergoing the highest rates of landscape modification.",

  abstract = "Pool-breeding amphibian populations operate at multiple scales,
              from the individual pool to surrounding upland habitat to
              clusters of pools. When metapopulation dynamics play a role in
              long-term viability, conservation efforts limited to the
              protection of individual pools or even pools with associated
              upland habitat may be ineffective over the long term if
              connectivity among pools is not maintained. Connectivity becomes
              especially important and difficult to assess in regions where
              suburban sprawl is rapidly increasing land development, road
              density, and traffic rates. We developed a model of connectivity
              among vernal pools for the four ambystomatid salamanders that
              occur in Massachusetts and applied it to the nearly 30,000
              potential ephemeral wetlands across the state. The model was
              based on a modification of the kernel estimator (a density
              estimator commonly used in home range studies) that takes
              landscape resistance into account. The model was parameterized
              with empirical migration distances for spotted salamanders
              (Ambystoma maculatum), dispersal distances for marbled
              salamanders (A. opacum), and expert-derived estimates of
              landscape resistance. The model ranked vernal pools in
              Massachusetts by local, neighborhood, and regional connectivity
              and by an integrated measure of connectivity, both statewide and
              within ecoregions. The most functionally connected pool complexes
              occurred in southeastern and northeastern Massachusetts, areas
              with rapidly increasing suburban development. In a sensitivity
              analysis estimates of pool connectivity were relatively
              insensitive to uncertainty in parameter estimates, especially at
              the local and neighborhood scales. Our connectivity model could
              be used to prioritize conservation efforts for vernal-pool

              pool-based approaches.",

              primarily by size. Decisions concerning wetland destruction or

              assumptions: (1) small wetlands contain water for short portions
              of the year; (2) small wetlands support few species; and (3)
              species found in small wetlands are also found in larger
              wetlands. We tested these assumptions using data on wetland size,
              relative hydroperiod (drying scores), and relative species
              richness of amphibians in depression wetlands of the southeastern
              United States. We found a significant (p = 0.03) but weak (r(2) =

              relationship (p = 0.48) between amphibian species richness and

  abstract = "The goal of this study was to examine how introduced trout
              influence the distributions and abundances of a sub-alpine
              amphibian assemblage whose members display a variety of different
              life-history and defence strategies. Our study was conducted in
              the sub-alpine lentic habitats of three wilderness areas that
              form the core of the Klamath-Siskiyou Bioregion of northern
              California, a biodiversity 'hotspot' that supports the highest
              diversity of sub-alpine, lentic-breeding amphibians in the
              western USA. These wilderness areas contain no native fishes, but
              all have been populated with non-native trout for recreational
              fishing. Five of the eight amphibian species that occur in this
              region were sufficiently common to use in our study; these
              included one that breeds in both temporary and permanent waters
              and is palatable to fish (Pacific treefrog, Pseudacris regilla),
              two that breed primarily in permanent waters and are unpalatable
              to fish (western toad, Bufo boreas, and rough-skinned newt,
              Taricha granulosa), and two that breed primarily in permanent
              waters and are palatable to fish (Cascades frog, Rana cascadae,
              and long-toed salamander, Ambystoma macrodactylum). Based on life
              histories and predator defence strategies (i.e. palatable or
              not), we predicted that the three palatable species would likely
              be negatively correlated with introduced trout, but with P.
              regilla less impacted because of its use of both temporary and
              permanent waters. We predicted that B. boreas and T. granulosa
              would not be significantly correlated with introduced trout due
              to the lack of any predator/prey interactions between them. We
              surveyed 728 pond, lake, or wet meadow sites during the summers
              of 1999-2002, using timed gill-net sets to measure trout
              occurrence and relative density, and visual encounter surveys to
              determine amphibian presence and abundance. We used
              semiparametric logistic regression models to quantify the effect
              of trout presence/absence and density on the probability of
              finding amphibian species in a water body while accounting for
              variation within and among the various lentic habitats sampled.
              The distributions of P. regilla, A. macrodactylum and R. cascadae
              were strongly negatively correlated with trout presence across
              all three wilderness areas. Ambystoma macrodactylum was 44 times
              more likely to be found in lakes without fish than in lakes with
              fish. Rana cascadae and P. regilla were 3.7 and 3.0 times more
              likely, respectively, to be found in fishless than
              fish-containing waters. In contrast, the two unpalatable species
              were either uncorrelated (T. granulosa) or positively correlated
              (B. boreas) with fish presence. We found that the relative
              density of fish (catch per unit effort) was negatively correlated
              with the combined abundances of the three palatable amphibians,
              and also with both the length and the condition of the fish
              themselves. Our results are consistent with a compelling body of
              evidence that introduced fishes greatly alter the aquatic
              community structure of mountain lakes, ponds, and wet meadows.",

              Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis) have been widely introduced.
              Amphibians that evolved in fishless habitats often lack the
              necessary chemical defenses and behavioral responses to avoid
              predation. True Toads (family Bufonidae), however, possess
              noxious chemicals that often deter predators. Our goal was to
              test whether eggs, tadpoles, and postmetamorphic toads of A.
              canorus are a palatable food source for S. fontinalis, assess the
              antipredator behavior of tadpoles of A. canorus by exposing them
              to various predator chemical cues, and determine sublethal
              effects on three lifestages of A. canorus from sampling by S.
              fontinalis. We found that eggs, tadpoles, and postmetamorphic
              toads of A. canorus exhibit absolute unpalatability to S.
              fontinalis. In addition, tadpoles of A. canorus did not exhibit a
              significant difference in behavior when exposed to chemical
              stimuli. Moreover, observational experiments revealed that trout
              would sample, then reject lifestages of A. canorus unharmed,
              while trout readily consumed tadpoles of Pacific Chorus Frog
              (Pseudacris regilla). We therefore infer that early lifestages of
              A. canorus likely possess existing chemical defenses as a result
              of interactions with native predators that adequately protect
              them from nonnative trout predation. Although trout removal often
              leads to the recovery of other Sierra Nevada amphibian
              populations, trout removal would likely have no effect on
              populations of A. canorus given our results. Therefore, we
              suggest that other factors thought to be contributing toward A.
              canorus decline should be investigated before efforts are
              concentrated on removing trout from toad habitats.",

              Inconspicuous benthic invertebrate taxa, small crustacean
              zooplankton (<1 mm), and rotiferan zooplankton (<0.2 mm) were
              either unaffected by fish or increased in the presence of fish.
              For both the benthic macroinvertebrate community and the
              zooplankton community as a whole, fish disappearance was followed
              by a steady change away from the configuration characteristic of
              fish-containing lakes and toward that of lakes that had never
              been stocked. Both communities remained markedly different from
              those in never-stocked lakes 5-10 yr after fish disappearance and
              converged on the configuration of never-stocked lakes only 11-20
              yr after fish disappearance. Recovery was likely facilitated by
              the winged adult stages of many benthic macroinvertebrates,
              resting eggs of zooplankton, and nearby source populations of
              frogs. However, many frog populations have disappeared since the
              time that lakes in this study reverted to a fishless condition,
              and the viability of zooplankton egg banks should decline in
              fish-containing lakes over time. As a result, faunal resilience
              may be lower in lakes that revert to a fishless condition today
              than is suggested by the results of our study. These findings
              have important implications for the restoration of alpine lake
              ecosystems.",

  abstract = "The ratio of the number of taxa observed at a site to that
              expected to occur in the absence of anthropogenic impacts (O/E)
              is an ecologically meaningful measure of the degree of faunal
              alteration. We used O/E ratios to describe the response by
              amphibian, reptile, benthic macroinvertebrate, and zooplankton
              taxa in originally fishless lakes in Yosemite National Park to
              the introduction and subsequent disappearance of nonnative fish.
              To quantify resistance (the degree to which a system is altered
              when the environment changes) and resilience (the degree to which
              a system returns to its previous configuration once the
              perturbation is removed), we compared O/E ratios between lakes
              that were never stocked, were previously stocked and still
              contained fish, or were previously stocked but had reverted to a
              fishless condition. On average, stocked- fish-present sites had
              16\% fewer taxa than never-stocked sites (O/E = 0.84 vs. 1.00,
              respectively). This statistically significant difference in O/E
              ratios indicates that native fauna had relatively low resistance
              to fish introductions. Resistance was inversely related to fish
              density and elevation, and directly related to water depth.
              Vulnerability to impacts of trout predation differed markedly
              between faunal groups, being high for amphibians, reptiles,
              conspicuous benthic invertebrates, and zooplankton and low for
              inconspicuous benthic invertebrates. O/E ratios in
              stocked-now-fishless sites were significantly higher (1.00) than
              those in stocked-fish-present sites and were not significantly
              different from those in never-stocked sites, indicating that this
              fauna had high resilience. For stocked-now-fishless sites, the
              relationship between the O/E ratio and the number of years since
              fish disappearance indicated that taxonomic composition recovered
              to closely resemble that of never-stocked lakes in less than two
              years following fish disappearance. Collectively, these result's
              indicate that despite strong effects of an introduced predatory
              fish on community structure, these systems recover quickly and
              predictably following fish removal.",

               native amphibian communities. We sought to determine whether
               Foothill Yellow-legged Frog (Rana boylii) larvae could recognize
               non-native Smallmouth Bass (Micropterus dolomieu) as a predatory
               threat. Through a series of laboratory experiments, we examined
               the initial and overall behavioral responses of larvae to native
               predators (Rough-skinned newts, Taricha granulosa), introduced
               predators (M. dolomieu), and native non-predatory fish (Speckled
               Dace, Rhinichthys osculus). Each experiment examined a different
               potential mode of detection including chemical cues; visual
               cues; or a combination of chemical, visual, and mechanical cues.
               Initially, larvae of R. boylii responded with an increase in
               activity levels when exposed to visual cues of M. dolomieu.
               Analyses of overall responses suggested that individual larvae
               of R. boylii require multiple cues to facilitate predator
               detection. When exposed to multiple cues of their native
               predator, larvae responded with a significant reduction in
               activity levels. Those larvae exposed to cues of the non-native
               predator displayed similar behaviors relative to control cues.
               Consequently, larvae of R. boylii appear to be especially

              Ambystoma macrodacrylum columbianum. Larvae observed in a natural
              pond engaged in cannibalism. Additionally, these larvae possessed
              significantly longer and wider heads, as well as larger vomerine
              teeth, than did conspecifics of the same size reared in the
              laboratory for 1 month after capture. This variation in trophic
              structures is consistent with the characteristics of ''cannibal''
              morphs that have been documented for larvae of another salamander
              species. We extend current knowledge of the development of this
              morphology by using multivariate statistical analysis to examine,
              fur-ther, a possible basis for this variation in head shape.
              Principal component analysis indicated that after the removal of
              the effects of body size, variation in the distance between the
              eyes (interocular width) accounted for most of the remaining
              total overall variation in head shape. Multivariate ontogenetic
              trajectories of head shape, constructed from linear regressions
              of principal components (measures of size and shape), were
              equivalent for the two larval samples. These statistical analyses
              indicate that this trophic polymorphism is not due to differences
              in either the rate of change in head shape relative to overall
              size or the size at which the divergence in head shape begins.
              Rather, morphological variation in larval A. m. columbianum may
              be due to fluctuations in the presence of key, influential
              environmental factors, as has been demonstrated for other larval

              link between the two, particularly in the tropics, where
              amphibian species richness and abundance are high. In the past 20
              years, amphibian populations have declined dramatically around
              the world; numbers have decreased catastrophically in protected
              upland sites throughout the neotropics, usually resulting in the
              disappearance of over 75\% of amphibians at a given site,
              particularly those species that breed in streams. Most studies of
              amphibian declines have focused on identifying causes and
              documenting changes in adult abundance, rather than on their
              ecological consequences. Here, we review evidence for the
              potential ecological effects of catastrophic amphibian declines,
              focusing on neotropical highland streams, where impacts will
              likely be greatest. Evidence to date suggests that amphibian

              effects, including changes in algal community structure and
              primary production, altered organic matter dynamics, changes in
              other consumers such as aquatic insects and riparian predators,
              and reduced energy transfers between streams and riparian
              habitats. Furthermore, because of habitat and functional
              differences between larvae and adults in most amphibians, the

              correlated with frog population status (i.e., fraction of
              suitable water bodies occupied within 2 km of a site) by
              measuring pesticide concentrations in multiple media twice at 28

              which may render them vulnerable to habitat fragmentation. The
              red-spotted toad (Bufo punctatus) in the southwestern United
              States and Mexico commonly inhabits wetlands that have become
              much smaller and fewer since the late Pleistocene. This study
              tests two predictions based on metapopulation theory, that the
              incidence of habitat patch occupancy is directly related to patch
              size and that it is inversely related to patch isolation, and a
              third, potentially competing hypothesis, that patch occupancy is
              influenced by local environmental conditions. In a 20 000 km(2)
              area of the eastern Mojave Desert, 128 potential habitat patches
              (primarily springs) were identified and surveyed for local
              environmental characteristics and presence/ absence of B.
              punctatus. Patch size metrics reflected extent of water and
              riparian vegetation of several types. Patch isolation metrics
              were based on nearest-neighbor distances, calculated both as
              Euclidian distance and distance via connecting drainage channels.
              B. punctatus was found at 73\% of the sites, including all of the
              16 historic (pre-1970) sites. Patches were generally quite small,
              with water extending a median distance of only 200 m and median
              area of 72 m. Median nearest-neighbor distances among patches
              were 1.8 km Euclidian distance (range: 0.4-22.0 km) and 6.8 km
              via drainage channels (range: 0.5-64.9 km). Based on stepwise
              multiple logistic regression, the incidence of patch occupancy
              increased significantly with patch size and was also
              significantly related to elevation, latitude, and four metrics
              that were associated with rocky terrain, periodic scouring water
              flows, and ephemeral water. In contrast, incidence of patch
              occupancy was not significantly related to patch isolation. These
              findings are consistent with a ``patchy population'' model,
              rather than the classical equilibrium metapopulation model,
              implying frequent dispersal among patches and virtually no local
              extinctions. We speculate that B. punctatus in the Mojave Desert
              today occurs primarily in a patchy population or populations
              within mountain ranges that are isolated from patchy populations
              in other ranges. The influence of local environmental
              characteristics on patch occupancy demonstrates the importance of
              including patch quality metrics in tests of predictions for patch
              occupancy based on metapopulation theory.",

              discuss how this application differs from a conventional
              occupancy approach. We found that the probability of detecting
              the pathogen, conditional on presence of the pathogen in the
              anuran population, was related to amphibian development stage,
              day of the year, elevation, and human activities.

              of native amphibians and 66.4\% of 40 populations of nonnative
              Rana catesbeiana tested. We found little evidence to support any
              spatial hypotheses concerning the probability that the pathogen
              occurs in a population, but did find evidence of some taxonomic
              variation. We discuss the interpretation of occupancy model
              parameters, when, unlike a conventional occupancy application,

              success of pond-breeding amphibians. Over 3 years, we monitored

              species of amphibians require ponds to be flooded for 125 days to
              at least 580 days. For species that breed primarily in seasonally
              flooded ponds, 95\% of metamorphs had emigrated front breeding

              declines and extinctions. In some areas of the Sierra Nevada of

              rapid extinction of local populations of the mountain

              amphibian populations. However, most studies have not provided

              a critical need to investigate the mechanisms that underlie
              patterns of distribution and abundance. In order to understand
              the population- and species-level implications of habitat loss
              and fragmentation, it is necessary to move from site-specific
              inferences to assessments of how the influences of multiple
              factors interact across extensive landscapes to influence
              population size and population connectivity. The goal of this
              paper is to summarize the state of knowledge, identify
              information gaps and suggest research approaches to provide
              reliable knowledge and effective conservation of amphibians in
              landscapes experiencing habitat loss and fragmentation. Reliable
              inferences require attention to species-specific ecological
              characteristics and their interactions with environmental
              conditions at a range of spatial scales. Habitat connectivity
              appears to play a key role in regional viability of amphibian
              populations. in amphibians, population connectivity is
              predominantly effected through juvenile dispersal. The
              preponderance of evidence suggests that the short-term impact of
              habitat loss and fragmentation increases with dispersal ability.
              However, species with limited dispersal abilities are likely to
              be equally imperiled by habitat loss and fragmentation over
              longer time periods. Rigorous understanding of the effects of
              habitat loss and fragmentation on amphibians will require
              species-specific, multi-scale, mechanistic investigations, and
              will be benefit from integrating large empirical field studies

              influences of habitat structure across large spatial extents on
              gene flow and population connectivity. Conservation strategies

              cover suitable for the species; movement upslope to land-cover

              upslope to areas that previously were outside the species' range;
              and movement upslope to cooler areas within the current range.
              Areas in the final scenario will become isolated as climate

              of reptiles and amphibians and create barriers to migration and
              dispersal. I investigated the number of times turtles and other
              herpetofauna attempted to cross a 4-lane highway at Lake Jackson,
              Florida, USA, during a period of severe drought (Feb-Apr 2000).
              Levels of road mortality were so high that I designed and
              installed a temporary drift fence system to work with an existing
              drainage culvert and for the next 2.5 years I evaluated its
              effectiveness at reducing road mortality and facilitating
              migration. I monitored roads and fences several times per day for
              44 months, during both drought and non-drought conditions. A
              total of 10,229 reptiles and amphibians of 44 species were found
              either road killed or alive behind drift fences: 8,842 turtles,
              838 frogs, 363 snakes, 152 lizards, 32 alligators, and 2
              salamanders. Drift fences combined with intensive monitoring
              greatly reduced turtle road kills and facilitated the use of an
              under-highway culvert. Along a 0.7-km section of the highway,
              turtle mortality before installation of the fence (11.9/km/day)
              was significantly greater than post-fence mortality (0.09/km/day)
              and only 84 of 8,475 turtles climbed or penetrated the drift
              fences. Pre-fence data provided strong evidence that turtles
              cannot successfully cross all 4 lanes of U.S. Highway 27, as 95\%
              of 343 turtles were killed as they first entered the highway
              adjacent to the shoulder and the remaining 5\% were killed in the
              first two traffic lanes. According to a probability model, the
              likelihood of a turtle successfully crossing U.S. Highway 27
              decreased from 32\% in 1977 to only 2\% in 2001 due to a 162\%
              increase in traffic volume. Therefore, at least 98\% of turtles
              diverted by the fences probably would have been killed if fences
              were not in place. The results of this study represent the
              highest attempted road-crossing rate ever published for turtles
              (1,263/km/year). Because of demographic and life history
              constraints, turtle populations may incur irreversible declines
              in areas where road mortality is high, especially when mass
              migrations are triggered by periods of drought.",

  abstract = "Reports of malformed amphibians and global amphibian declines
              have led to public concern, particularly because amphibians are
              thought to be indicator species of overall environmental health.
              The topic also draws scientific attention because there is no
              obvious, simple answer to the question of what is causing
              amphibian declines? Complex interactions of several anthropogenic
              factors are probably at work, and understanding amphibian
              declines may thus serve as a model for understanding species
              declines in general. While we have fewer answers than we would
              like, there are six leading hypotheses that we sort into two
              classes. For class I hypotheses, alien species, over-exploitation
              and land use change, we have a good understanding of the
              ecological mechanisms underlying declines; these causes have
              affected amphibian populations negatively for more than a
              century. However, the question remains as to whether the
              magnitude of these negative effects increased in the 1980s, as
              scientists began to notice a global decline of amphibians.
              Further, remedies for these problems are not simple. For class II
              hypotheses, global change (including UV radiation and global
              climate change), contaminants and emerging infectious diseases we
              have a poor, but improving understanding of how each might cause
              declines. Class II factors involve complex and subtle mechanistic
              underpinnings, with probable interactions among multiple
              ecological and evolutionary variables. They may also interact
              with class I hypotheses. Suspected mechanisms associated with
              class II hypotheses are relatively recent, dating from at least
              the middle of the 20th century. Did these causes act
              independently or in concert with pre-existing negative forces of
              class I hypotheses to increase the rate of amphibian declines to
              a level that drew global attention? We need more studies that
              connect the suspected mechanisms underlying both classes of
              hypotheses with quantitative changes in amphibian population
              sizes and species numbers. An important step forward in this task
              is clarifying the hypotheses and conditions under which the
              various causes operate alone or together.",

  author   = "Arntzen, J W and Themudo, G E",
  abstract = "Aim To identify the ecological factors associated with the range
              borders of two amphibian species, to investigate geographical
              variation in environmental parameters that determine species
              range limits, and to develop a testable hypothesis on the
              species' biogeographical history. Location Portugal and Spain.
              Methods We documented the distribution of two species of marbled
              newt (Triturus marmoratus and Triturus pygmaeus) from atlas data,
              survey data and six latitudinal transects. Countrywide
              ecogeographical models were constructed from presence-only data
              and a suite of 19 environmental parameters. Local ecogeographical
              models were constructed along the contact zone. Results Triturus
              marmoratus and T. pygmaeus share a parapatric range border from
              coastal Portugal to central Spain. Ecogeographical models
              performed better in descriptive mode (for the country where they
              were developed) than in predictive mode (when extrapolated for
              the neighbouring country). This suggests the existence of spatial
              variation for parameters that determine the species range
              borders. Local models showed good performance in Spain and
              western Portugal. Parameters dominating the models were climatic
              (precipitation, temperature and solar radiation), geographical
              (altitude) and geophysical (soil permeability). Enclaves in the
              distribution of T. marmoratus/T. pygmaeus also corresponded with
              environmental parameters. Poor-fitting local models were found in
              central Portugal, where the mutual range border of the two
              species coincides with the River Tejo. Main conclusions The fit
              and predictive performance of the ecogeographical models suggest
              that equilibrium conditions have been reached over most of the
              contact zone. Parameter selection, field observations and natural
              history knowledge led us to identify, in terms of reproductive
              strategy, a stable species with regular, but low annual
              recruitment (T. marmoratus) vs. an opportunistic species with
              fluctuating 'all-or-nothing' annual recruitment (T. pygmaeus).
              Ecological parapatry derives from the use of permanent ponds for
              breeding in T. marmoratus vs. ephemeral ponds used by T.
              pygmaeus. Enclaves in the distribution show that, historically,
              T. pygmaeus has been displacing T. marmoratus. In central
              Portugal, where the model fit is poor, the advance of T. pygmaeus
              is currently impeded by the River Tejo. We predict that once this
              barrier has been crossed, the contact zone will move c. 40 km to
              the north. As T. marmoratus and T. pygmaeus are hybridizing
              species, we predict the occasional presence of T. marmoratus
              genes in areas that have changed occupancy.",

              towards the causes of ``enigmatic'' population declines appears
              paradoxical given the almost unanimous recognition that habitat
              change is the primary cause of population declines worldwide.
              justification for this shift is given by the growing concern
              associated with more novel stressors, as well as a general
              presumption that we have a good understanding of the ecological
              mechanisms that underlie the effects of habitat change. We tested
              the validity of this presumption by conducting a global scale
              review of the state of research regarding the consequences of
              structural habitat change (fragmentation, logging, fire, native
              regeneration and plantations) for amphibians and reptiles. We
              reveal a number of serious deficiencies, namely that existing
              research efforts are characterised by distinct geographic and
              study biases (e.g. most studies are confined to North America and
              focus on amphibians), a lack of clear consensus regarding the
              consequences of many forms of habitat change with many studies
              reporting seemingly contradictory results, and a number of common
              limitations in sampling design. The recent shift in research
              agenda towards the study of more novel stressors, and away from a
              focus on structural habitat change, cannot therefore be easily
              explained by differences in our understanding of the threats

              on amphibian populations it is necessary to determine
              species-specific habitat use and how this influences abundance.
              While a number of studies have examined the influence of
              competition and predation in stream salamander assemblages in the
              southern Appalachian Mountains, there remains a relative lack of
              knowledge on the microhabitat use of these species. Using
              area-con strained daytime searches, we investigated microhabitat
              use and abundance for stream-breeding salamanders in mature
              forests in southern Appalachian streams from May to August 2004.
              We found that leaf litter depth, soil moisture, and canopy cover
              were all higher and soil temperature was lower in plots where
              stream salamanders were encountered compared to plots where
              salamanders were not encountered. A regression analysis using the
              information-theoretic approach (AIC) revealed that the model that
              included distance from stream, leaf litter depth, soil moisture,
              and soil temperature had the strongest support for predicting
              stream salamander abundance at the landscape level (omega(i) =
              0.99). Microhabitat use in many species of stream salamanders is
              mediated by a number of complex factors including environmental
              variables, competition, and predation. Alteration of habitats
              likely results in increased competition and predation rates and
              subsequent local population declines, so it is imperative to
              mitigate the effects of practices such as even-aged timber

  abstract  = "? Abstract?Declines and losses of amphibian populations are a
               global problem with complex local causes. These may include
               ultraviolet radiation, predation, habitat modification,
               environmental acidity and toxicants, diseases, changes in
               climate or weather patterns, and interactions among these
               factors. Understanding the extent of the problem and its nature
               requires an understanding of how local factors affect the
               dynamics of local populations. Hypotheses about population
               behavior must be tested against appropriate null hypotheses. We
               generated null hypotheses for the behavior of amphibian
               populations using a model, and we used them to test hypotheses
               about the behavior of 85 time series taken from the literature.
               Our results suggest that most amphibian populations should
               decrease more often than they increase, due to highly variable
               recruitment and less variable adult mortality. During the period
               covered by our data (1951?1997), more amphibian populations
               decreased than our model predicted. However, there was no
               indication that the proportion of populations decreasing changed
               over time. In addition, our review of the literature suggests
               that many if not most amphibians exist in metapopulations.
               Understanding the dynamics of amphibian populations will require
               an integration of studies on and within local populations and at
               the metapopulation level.",

              ignore the processes by which species ranges shift. By analysing
              the 'climate paths' that range shifts might follow, and two key
              range-shift processes--dispersal and population persistence--we
              show that short-term climatic and population characteristics have
              dramatic effects on range-shift forecasts. By employing this
              approach with 15 amphibian species in the western USA, we make
              unexpected predictions. First, inter-decadal variability in
              climate change can prevent range shifts by causing gaps in
              climate paths, even in the absence of geographic barriers.
              Second, the hitherto unappreciated trait of persistence during
              unfavourable climatic conditions is critical to species range
              shifts. Third, climatic fluctuations and low persistence could
              lead to endangerment even if the future potential range size is
              large. These considerations may render habitat corridors
              ineffectual for some species, and conservationists may need to
              consider managed relocation and augmentation of in situ

  author   = "Bauer, Dana Marie and Paton, Peter W C and Swallow, Stephen K",
  abstract = "Recent declines in amphibian populations have raised concern
              among conservation biologists, with habitat loss and degradation
              due to human activities among the leading causes. The most common
              policies used to protect the habitat of pond-breeding amphibians
              are wetland regulations that safeguard the wetland itself.
              However, many amphibians spend much of their adult lives foraging
              and over-wintering in upland habitats and exist as
              metapopulations with dispersal among ponds. With no consideration
              of lands in the dispersal matrix, wetland policies may be
              ineffective at protecting amphibians or other wetland species
              that disperse across the landscape. This paper examined the
              adequacy and cost effectiveness of alternative conservation
              policies and their corresponding land use patterns on the
              long-term persistence of pond-breeding amphibians in exurban
              landscapes. We used computer simulations to compare outcomes of
              wetland buffer policies and broader landscape-wide conservation
              policies across a variety of landscape scenarios, and we
              conducted sensitivity analyses on the model's species parameters
              in order to generalize our results to other wetland species.
              Results showed that, in the majority of human-dominated
              landscapes, some amount of dispersal matrix protection is
              necessary for long-term species persistence. However, in
              landscapes with extremely low-intensity land use (e.g.,
              low-density residential housing) and high pond density, wetland
              buffer policies may be all that is required. It is not always
              more cost effective to protect core habitat over the dispersal
              matrix, a common conservation practice. Conservation costs that
              result from forgone residential, commercial, or agricultural
              activities can vary substantially but increase in a nonlinear
              manner regardless of land use zoning. There appears to be a
              threshold around an average habitat patch occupancy level of
              80\%, after which opportunity costs rise dramatically.",

              the unequivocal demonstration of decline in situations where
              populations may be undergoing natural fluctuations in abundance.
              We describe the application of a genetic test for bottlenecks
              (Cornuet \& Luikart 1996) that should distinguish between natural
              oscillations and true population declines. British natterjack
              toads (Bufo calamita) provide examples of populations that have
              not declined in recent decades, populations that have declined
              and populations in which trends are unclear. Microsatellite
              allele frequency data from these populations were tested for
              heterozygote excess and shifts in allele frequency distributions,
              and inferences from these computations about bottlenecks (i.e.,
              persistently smaller population sizes than the recent means) were
              compared with demographic information. The genetic test correctly
              identified bottlenecks and should therefore prove useful in

              differentiate unique headwater types using 69 abiotic and
              vegetation variables measured at three spatial scales, and then
              to reduce these to informative subsets; (2) determine if distinct

              (Pacifastacus leniusculus) represented different trophic
              positions, value as commercial resources (steelhead), sensitivity
              to environmental stress (amphibians), and indicators of
              biodiversity (herpetofauna species richness). Herpetofauna
              species richness did not differ, but abundances of steelhead
              trout, signal crayfish, and amphibian richness all differed
              significantly among tributary types. Niche models indicated that

              attributes at multiple spatial scales, both within and around

              attributes, reflecting the high environmental heterogeneity in
              headwater tributaries across this large watershed. These niche
              attributes represented a wide range of headwater environments,

              In the eastern USA many of the studies have focused on fully
              terrestrial plethodontid salamanders, while information on
              stream-breeding plethodontids remains relatively lacking. Using
              two different survey methods (area-constrained daytime searches

              Appalachian streams from May to August 2005. We found that
              overall stream salamander abundance and terrestrial habitat use
              was reduced in stands 81 years old. The decreased abundance and
              terrestrial habitat use was accompanied by a decrease in leaf

              concern and their causes have generated substantial debate.
              Habitat fragmentation is considered one important cause of
              amphibian decline. However, if fragmentation is to be invoked as
              a mechanism of amphibian decline, it must first be established
              that dispersal is prevalent among contiguous amphibian
              populations using formal movement estimators. In contrast, if
              dispersal is naturally low in amphibians, fragmentation can be
              disregarded as a cause of amphibian declines and conservation
              efforts can be focused elsewhere. We examined dispersal rates in
              Columbia spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) using
              capture-recapture analysis of over 10,000 frogs in combination
              with genetic analysis of microsatellite loci in replicate basins.
              We found that frogs had exceptionally high juvenile dispersal
              rates (up to 62\% annually) over long distances (>5km), large
              elevation gains (>750m) and steep inclines (36 degrees incline
              over 2km) that were corroborated by genetic data showing high
              gene flow. These findings show that dispersal is an important
              life-history feature of some amphibians and suggest that habitat

  author   = "Altmoos, Michael and Henle, Klaus",
  abstract = "Abstract Habitat models for animal species are important tools in
              conservation planning. We assessed the need to consider several
              scales in a case study for three amphibian and two grasshopper
              species in the post-mining landscapes near Leipzig (Germany). The
              two species groups were selected because habitat analyses for
              grasshoppers are usually conducted on one scale only whereas
              amphibians are thought to depend on more than one spatial scale.
              First, we analysed how the preference to single habitat variables
              changed across nested scales. Most environmental variables were
              only significant for a habitat model on one or two scales, with
              the smallest scale being particularly important. On larger
              scales, other variables became significant, which cannot be
              recognized on lower scales. Similar preferences across scales
              occurred in only 13 out of 79 cases and in 3 out of 79 cases the
              preference and avoidance for the same variable were even reversed
              among scales. Second, we developed habitat models by using a
              logistic regression on every scale and for all combinations of
              scales and analysed how the quality of habitat models changed
              with the scales considered. To achieve a sufficient accuracy of
              the habitat models with a minimum number of variables, at least
              two scales were required for all species except for Bufo viridis,
              for which a single scale, the microscale, was sufficient. Only
              for the European tree frog (Hyla arborea), at least three scales
              were required. The results indicate that the quality of habitat
              models increases with the number of surveyed variables and with
              the number of scales, but costs increase too. Searching for
              simplifications in multi-scaled habitat models, we suggest that 2
              or 3 scales should be a suitable trade-off, when attempting to
              define a suitable microscale.",

              of these declines are a matter of continued research, but
              probably include climate change, land-use change and spread of

              threats in relation to the global distribution of amphibian

              negatively affected by climate change are projected to be found
              in Africa, parts of northern South America and the Andes. Regions
              with the highest projected impact of land-use and climate change
              coincide, but there is little spatial overlap with regions highly
              threatened by the fungal disease. Overall, the areas harbouring
              the richest amphibian faunas are disproportionately more affected

              Amphibian declines are likely to accelerate in the twenty-first

              California. Based on 322 bp of mitochondrial cytochrome b
              sequence data, we found limited support for the monophyly of B.
              canorus and its closely related congener B. exsul to the
              exclusion of the widespread western toad B. boreas. However, B.
              exsul was always phylogenetically nested within B. canorus,

              (single-strand conformation polymorphism) analysis of 372
              individual B. canorus from 28 localities in Yosemite and Kings
              Canyon National Parks revealed no shared haplotypes among these
              two regions and lead us to interpret these two parks as distinct

              different pattern, with substantial variation among breeding

              B. canorus as well as among Yosemite ponds, we found an
              isolation-by-distance pattern suggestive of a stepping stone

              such a pattern, suggesting that movement patterns of toads may be
              quite different in these nearby parklands. Our data imply that
              management for B. canorus should focus at the individual pond
              level, and effective management may necessitate reintroductions
              if local extirpations occur. A brief review of other
              pond-breeding anurans suggests that highly structured populations
              are often the case, and thus that our results for B. canorus may

               sites of R. boylii with copepods in 2006, infestation ranged
               from 2.9\% of individuals upstream to 58.3\% downstream. In
               2008, copepods were absent from the most upstream sites and
               infested up to 28.6\% of individuals sampled at downstream
               locations. Copepods most frequently embedded near a hind limb or
               the cloaca. Among individuals with parasites in 2006, 26.5\% had
               morphological abnormalities compared to 1.1\% of un-infested
               individuals. In 2008 when the infestation peak occurred late in
               development (post Gosner stage 39), abnormalities were not
               associated with copepod infestation. In both years, recently
               metamorphosed frogs with copepods were, on average, slightly
               smaller than those not infested. These occurrences represent a
               sudden increase in local prevalence atypical for this river
               ecosystem. Previously we had only once seen copepods on
               amphibians (on non-native Bullfrogs, Rana catesbeiana), six km
               further downstream. Pacific Chorus Frogs, Pseudacris regilla,
               which co-occur with R. boylii in shallow near shore habitats
               were not used as hosts. The data suggest that increasing summer
               water temperatures, decreased daily discharge, or a combination
               of both, promote outbreaks of this non-native parasite on an
               indigenous host, and could present a threat to the long-term
               conservation of R. boylii under the flow regime scenarios

               provide an opportunity to change flow regimes and reduce
               negative effects on sensitive aquatic biota. The volume of flow,
               timing and ramping rate of spring spills, and magnitude of
               aseasonal pulsed flows have potentially negative effects on the
               early life stages of amphibians, such as the Foothill
               yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii). Two-dimensional hydrodynamic
               modeling is one method to evaluate potential effects of flow
               variation on frog egg masses and tadpoles. We explored the
               usefulness of this technique by modeling habitat suitability
               under several pulsed flow scenarios in two river reaches in
               northern California, USA. We conducted analyses beyond simple
               weighted usable area calculations, such as quantifying the risk
               of scour or stranding, in order to quantify potential loss under
               different flow scenarios. The modeling results provided
               information on potential susceptibility to flow fluctuations as
               well as the influence of channel morphology on habitat
               suitability. Under each flow scenario, low percentages of
               suitable habitat remained suitable or were `buffered' from the
               pulse, creating high potential for scour of egg masses or
               tadpoles. However, due to differences in channel morphologies,
               the wide, shallow study site provided 2-3 times the buffering
               capacity of the entrenched study site. Additional analyses
               suggested that limited buffering capacity and lack of
               connectivity between suitable egg mass and tadpole habitats may
               explain why some hydraulically suitable habitats are unoccupied.

               the population level as a negative genetic correlation between
               traits that contribute to growth and survival? We addressed this
               question for a single population of Green Frog tadpoles (Rana
               clamitans) by estimating heritabilities and correlations of
               traits that mediate the trade-off. Burst speed, growth rate, and
               size varied among sires and were significantly heritable, but
               swimming activity in the presence and absence of predator odors
               was not. Differences among traits in heritability generally
               accorded with differences in genetic coefficients of variation,

               with any measure of predator avoidance or escape ability.
               Likewise, predator escape ability (burst speed) was not

              17 and 22 C. All infected animals developed clinical disease

               America, a region with a concentration of documented amphibian
               declines. Site-specific daily UV-B dose was estimated using
               modeled and field-collected data to incorporate the effects of
               elevation, landscape, and water-column dissolved organic carbon.
               Of the eight species we examined (Ambystoma gracile, Ambystoma
               macrodactylum, Bufo boreas, Pseudacris regilla, Rana cascadae,
               Rana leuteiventris, Rana muscosa, Taricha granulosa), two
               species (T. granulosa and A. macrodactylum) had quadratic
               relationships with UV-B that could have resulted from negative
               UV-B effects. Both species were most likely to occur at moderate
               UV-B levels. Ambystoma macrodactylum showed this pattern only in
               Glacier National Park. Occurrence of A. macrodactylum increased
               as UV-B increased in Olympic National Park despite UV-B levels
               similar to those recorded in Glacier. We also found marginal
               support for a negative association with UV-B for P. regilla in
               one of the two parks where it occurred. We did not find evidence
               of a negative UV-B effect for any other species. Much more work
               is still needed to determine whether UV-B, either alone or in
               concert with other factors, is causing widespread population
               losses in amphibians.",

              losses have been more severe than those of birds and mammals.
              Amphibian population declines are likely due to many factors
              including habitat loss, disease, contaminants, introduced species
              and ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation. The effect of UVB, however,
              varies widely among species and can vary within populations of
              the same species or at different life-history stages. This
              variation has often led to opposing conclusions about how UVB
              affects amphibians. We used meta-analysis techniques to explore
              the overall effects of UVB radiation on survival in amphibians.
              We also used recently developed factorial meta-analytic
              techniques to quantify potential interactions between UVB
              radiation and other stressors on amphibians. Ultraviolet-B
              radiation reduced survival of amphibians by 1.9-fold compared
              with shielded controls. Larvae were more susceptible to damage
              from UVB radiation compared with embryos, and salamanders were
              more susceptible compared with frogs and toads. Furthermore, UVB
              radiation interacted synergistically with other environmental
              stressors and resulted in greater than additive effects on
              survival when 2 stressors were present. Our results suggest that
              UVB radiation is an important stressor in amphibians,

              important for informing land management decisions and helping
              biologists better understand and remediate factors contributing
              to declines in amphibian populations. We built geospatial models
              of likely breeding habitats for each of four amphibian species
              that breed in Yellowstone National Park (YNP). We used field data
              collected in 2000-2002 from 497 sites among 16 basins and
              predictor variables from geospatial models produced from remotely
              sensed data (e.g., digital elevation model, complex topographic
              index, landform data, wetland probability, and vegetative cover).
              Except for 31 sites in one basin that were surveyed in both 2000
              and 2002, all sites were surveyed once. We used polytomous
              regression to build statistical models for each species of
              amphibian from (1) field survey site data only, (2) field data
              combined with data from geospatial models, and (3) data from
              geospatial models only. Based on measures of receiver operating
              characteristic (ROC) scores, models of the second type best
              explained likely breeding habitat because they contained the most
              information (ROC values ranged from 0.70 to 0.88). However,
              models of the third type could be applied to the entire YNP
              landscape and produced maps that could be verified with reserve
              field data. Accuracy rates for models built for single years were
              highly variable, ranging from 0.30 to 0.78. Accuracy rates for
              models built with data combined from multiple years were higher
              and less variable, ranging from 0.60 to 0.80. Combining results
              from the geospatial multiyear models yielded maps of ``core''
              breeding areas (areas with high probability values for all three
              years) surrounded by areas that scored high for only one or two
              years, providing an estimate of variability among years. Such
              information can highlight landscape options for amphibian
              conservation. For example, our models identify alternative areas
              that could be protected for each species, including 6828-10 764

              declines, but their widespread distribution suggests involvement
              of global agents--increased UV-B radiation, for example. We
              addressed the hypothesis that differential sensitivity among
              species to UV radiation contributes to these population declines.
              We focused on species-specific differences in the abilities of
              eggs to repair UV radiation damage to DNA and differential
              hatching success of embryos exposed to solar radiation at natural
              oviposition sites. Quantitative comparisons of activities of a
              key UV-damage-specific repair enzyme, photolyase, among oocytes
              and eggs from 10 amphibian species were reproducibly
              characteristic for a given species but varied > 80-fold among the
              species. Levels of photolyase generally correlated with expected
              exposure of eggs to sunlight. Among the frog and toad species
              studied, the highest activity was shown by the Pacific treefrog
              (Hyla regilla), whose populations are not known to be in decline.
              The Western toad (Bufo boreas) and the Cascades frog (Rana
              cascadae), whose populations have declined markedly, showed
              significantly lower photolyase levels. In field experiments, the
              hatching success of embryos exposed to UV radiation was
              significantly greater in H. regilla than in R. cascadae and B.
              boreas. Moreover, in R. cascadae and B. boreas, hatching success
              was greater in regimes shielded from UV radiation compared with
              regimes that allowed UV radiation. These observations are thus

              spotted salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) to overwintered
              bullfrog tadpoles (R. catesbeiana), bluegill sunfish (Lepomis
              macrochirus), the insecticide carbaryl, and ammonium nitrate
              fertilizer in 1000-L mesocosms. Most significantly, our study
              demonstrated that the presence of multiple factors reduced
              survival of B. americanus and A. maculatum and lengthened larval
              periods of R. sphenocephala. The presence of bluegill had the
              largest impact on the community; it eliminated B. americanus and
              A. maculatum and reduced the abundance of R. sphenocephala.
              Chemical contaminants had the second strongest effect on the
              community with the insecticide, reducing A. maculatum abundance
              by 50\% and increasing the mass of anurans (frogs and toads) at
              metamorphosis; the fertilizer positively influenced time and mass
              at metamorphosis for both anurans and A. maculatum. Presence of

              community, they performed better in the presence of one another
              and in contaminated habitats. Our results indicate that
              predicting deleterious combinations from single-factor effects
              may not be straightforward. Our research supports the hypothesis

  author   = "Bowerman, Jay and Johnson, Pieter T J and Bowerman, Tracy",
  abstract = "While many predators completely consume their prey, others feed
              only on blood or tissue without killing the prey, sometimes
              causing ecologically significant levels of injury. We
              investigated the importance of sublethal predator attacks in
              driving an emerging issue of conservation importance:
              missing-limb deformities in amphibians. We combined long-term
              field data and manipulative experiments to evaluate the role of
              sublethal predation in causing abnormalities in two regions of
              central Oregon, U.S.A. Since 1988, western toads (Bufo boreas) in
              Lake Aspen have exhibited abnormalities dominated by partially
              missing limbs and digits at annual frequencies from <1\% to 35\%.
              On Broken Top volcano, we found comparable types and frequencies
              of abnormalities in Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae). Field
              sampling and observational data implicated two aquatic predators
              in these abnormality phenomena: introduced sticklebacks
              (Gasterosteus aculeatus) at Lake Aspen and corduliid dragonfly
              larvae (Somatochlora albicincta) at Broken Top. In experiments,
              these predators produced limb abnormalities identical to those
              observed in the respective regions. At Lake Aspen, in situ
              predator exclosures effectively eliminated abnormalities in
              toads, while comparisons among years with low and high
              stickleback abundance and between wetlands with and without
              sticklebacks reinforced the link between fish and amphibian
              abnormalities. Neither trematode parasite infection nor pesticide
              contamination could explain observed abnormalities. Our results
              suggest that predators are an important explanation for
              missing-limb abnormalities and highlight the ecological
              significance of sublethal predation in nature.",

              population declines and extinctions worldwide. The impact of this
              pathogen, however, varies markedly among amphibian species and
              populations. Following invasion into some areas of California's
              Sierra Nevada, Bd leads to rapid declines and local extinctions
              of frog populations (Rana muscosa, R. sierrae). In other areas,
              infected populations of the same frog species have declined but
              persisted at low host densities for many years. We present
              results of a 5-year study showing that infected adult frogs in
              persistent populations have low fungal loads, are surviving
              between years, and frequently lose and regain the infection. Here
              we put forward the hypothesis that fungal load dynamics can
              explain the different population-level outcomes of Bd observed in
              different areas of the Sierra Nevada and possibly throughout the
              world. We develop a model that incorporates the biological
              details of the Bd-host interaction. Importantly, model results
              suggest that host persistence versus extinction does not require
              differences in host susceptibility, pathogen virulence, or
              environmental conditions, and may be just epidemic and endemic
              population dynamics of the same host-pathogen system. The
              different disease outcomes seen in natural populations may result
              solely from density-dependent host-pathogen dynamics. The model
              also shows that persistence of Bd is enhanced by the long-lived
              tadpole stage that characterize these two frog species, and by
              nonhost Bd reservoirs.",

               in 208 small watersheds (2?4 km2) selected using an unequal
               probability design where watersheds occupied previously had a
               higher likelihood of being selected. For Rana sp., results
               corroborated other assessments that the taxon has declined

               (SE = 0.01) of watersheds rangewide, 0.47 (SE = 0.04) of
               watersheds with locality data from 1990?2001, and 0.02 (SE =
               0.03) of watersheds with locality data prior to 1990. Less than
               10\% of the watersheds contained large numbers of frogs (>500

               broad-scale predictions that highly aquatic, specialized anuran
               species have an increased extinction risk. The delayed

              delineations of riparian zones and buffers for various taxa are

              resources alone and do not consider impacts to wildlife and other
              terrestrial resources. Using two different survey methods
              (area-constrained daytime searches and nighttime visual encounter
              searches), we estimated core terrestrial habitat and buffer
              widths for stream-breeding salamanders in southern Appalachian
              streams from May to August 2004. A core terrestrial habitat of
              27.0 m encompassed 95\% of the salamander assemblage (four
              species of stream plethodontids), and an additional 50 m (to
              buffer edge effects) yielded a total buffer of 77.0 m. When each
              species of the assemblage was analyzed separately, the maximum

              wildlife dependent on riparian areas, land managers and policy

               the chytrid has been present in wild populations of B.
               attenuatus since at least 1973, and while infected salamanders
               collected in the wild exhibited 100\% mortality in the

               seasonally variable infection rates. Laboratory experiments

              stream-associated amphibians in late-seral redwood forests with
              those in mid-seral, second-growth forests to examine the
              continued (as opposed to immediate) effects of timber harvest on
              amphibian populations. Lacking pre-harvest data on amphibian
              abundances for streams in the second-growth stands, we assumed
              that nearby tributaries transecting late-seral stands with
              similar topography and flora harbored similar numbers of animals
              as second-growth stands prior to harvest. The study was conducted
              in two blocks (ca. 160km apart) with three matched-pairs of
              streams per block. The mid-seral forests (treatment, n=6) ranged
              from 37 to 60 years post-harvest; the late-seral forests
              (control, n=6) consisted of unharvested stands. We conducted
              nocturnal visual encounter surveys to sample for amphibians in
              spring, summer, and fall, for 2 years, with three repeated visits
              per season. Environmental factors, including water temperature,
              air temperature, and fine sediment loads were also recorded.
              Results indicated that amphibian species richness and relative
              abundances of lotic amphibians were significantly greater in the
              late-seral forest streams compared with streams transecting
              mid-seral forests. Water and air temperatures were similar in
              both forest types, but streams in mid-seral forests had greater
              amounts of fine sediments compared with the streams in the
              late-seral forests.",

               many aspects of conservation such as spread of emerging disease,
               proliferation of invasive species, changes in land-use patterns,
               and responses to global climate change. Movement processes are
               especially important for amphibian management and conservation
               as species declines and extinctions worldwide become ever more
               apparent. To better integrate behavioral and ecological data on
               amphibian movements with our use of spatially explicit
               demographic models and guide effective conservation solutions, I
               present 1) a synopsis of the literature regarding behavior,
               ecology, and evolution of movement in pond-breeding amphibians
               possessing biphasic life cycles to distinguish between migration
               and dispersal processes, 2) a working hypothesis of
               juvenile-based dispersal, and 3) a discussion of conservation
               issues that follow from distinguishing the spatial and temporal
               movements of amphibians at different scales. I define amphibian
               migration as intrapopulational, round-trip movements toward and
               away from aquatic breeding sites. Population-level management,
               in general, can be focused on spatial scales of 1.0?10.0 km and
               on importance of terrestrial connectivity. The ultimate goal of
               conservation for amphibians should be long-term regional
               persistence by addressing management issues at both local and

              is considered a major cause of decline for native amphibians. For

              the number of founders of non-native populations. Based on
              differences between populations, at least six independent
              introductions from the native range occurred in Europe, followed

              response to habitat alteration is to understand how fragmentation

              landscape genetic analyses to determine how habitat fragmentation
              due to timber harvest affects genetic population connectivity of
              the coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei), a forest-dwelling,
              stream-breeding amphibian. We compared rates of gene flow across
              old-growth (Olympic National Park) and logged landscapes (Olympic
              National Forest) and used spatial autoregression to estimate the
              effect of landscape variables on genetic structure. We detected
              higher overall genetic connectivity across the managed forest,
              although this was likely a historical signature of continuous
              forest before timber harvest began. Gene flow also occurred
              terrestrially, as connectivity was high across unconnected river
              basins. Autoregressive models demonstrated that closed forest and
              low solar radiation were correlated with increased gene flow. In
              addition, there was evidence for a temporal lag in the
              correlation of decreased gene flow with harvest, suggesting that
              the full genetic impact may not appear for several generations.
              Furthermore, we detected genetic evidence of population
              bottlenecks across the Olympic National Forest, including at
              sites that were within old-growth forest but surrounded by
              harvested patches. Collectively, this research suggests that
              absence of forest (whether due to natural or anthropogenic
              changes) is a key restrictor of genetic connectivity and that
              intact forested patches in the surrounding environment are
              necessary for continued gene flow and population connectivity.",

              increased exposure to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation and
              increased prevalence of disease have all been implicated at
              particular localities, the importance of global environmental
              change remains unclear. Here we report that pathogen outbreaks in

              climate-induced changes in UV-B exposure. Using long-term
              observational data and a field experiment, we examine patterns
              among interannual variability in precipitation, UV-B exposure and
              infection by a pathogenic oomycete, Saprolegnia ferax. Our
              findings indicate that climate-induced reductions in water depth
              at oviposition sites have caused high mortality of embryos by
              increasing their exposure to UV-B radiation and, consequently,
              their vulnerability to infection. Precipitation, and thus water
              depth/UV-B exposure, is strongly linked to El Ni{\~n}o/Southern

               current condition of the anuran fauna in a region predicted to
               experience, and experiencing, severe drying and warming.
               Location Five pairs of landscapes (each of c. 20 km2) -- one in
               each pair being almost completely wooded and the other cleared
               for agriculture -- across a 30,000 km2 region of northern
               Victoria, Australia. Methods Sites were repeatedly surveyed in
               the austral winter--spring breeding seasons of 2006 and 2007,
               with records collected of numbers of calling males and the
               presence of egg masses and tadpoles. We characterized the sites
               using static (e.g. dimensions, surrounding physiognomic
               characteristics such as tree cover) and labile (e.g. pH,
               dissolved oxygen) variables. Data were analysed using
               hierarchical Bayesian models. Results For calling males,
               landscape type did not affect densities or species richness
               measures. The availability of a grassy verge around water bodies
               was an important predictor for most species, but other labile
               and static variables seemed not to be important. Fewer than half
               of the species historically known from the region were recorded.
               There were no important predictors of occurrence of egg masses
               or tadpoles. Reproduction effectively may have failed over the
               period, with fewer than one in four sites showing evidence of
               egg masses or tadpoles. Main conclusions The proportion of sites
               at which some well-studied species (e.g. Crinia signifera,
               Limnodynastes dumerilii) were recorded has dropped substantially
               since the 1970s, as have average densities of calling males of
               Crinia spp. The remnant anuran fauna appears to be dominated by
               resilient and hardy species with low current diversity. The
               on-going (12+ years) drought in these landscapes suggests a
               bleak long-term prognosis for the few remaining species of

  abstract = "Studies on riparian buffers have usually focused on the amount of
              land needed as habitat for the terrestrial life stages of
              semiaquatic species. Nevertheless, the landscape surrounding
              wetlands is also important for other key processes, such as
              dispersal and the dynamics of metapopulations. Multiple elements
              that influence these processes should therefore be considered in
              the delineation of buffers. We analyzed landscape elements
              (forest cover, density of roads, and hydrographic network) in
              concentric buffers to evaluate the scale at which they influence
              stream amphibians in 77 distinct landscapes. To evaluate whether
              our results could be generalized to other contexts, we determined
              whether they were consistent across the study areas. Amphibians
              required buffers of 100-400 m of suitable terrestrial habitat,
              but interspecific differences in the amount of habitat were
              large. The presence of amphibians was related to roads and the
              hydrographic network at larger spatial scales (300-1500 m), which
              suggests that wider buffers are needed with these elements. This
              pattern probably arose because these elements influence dispersal
              and metapopulation persistence, processes that occur at large
              spatial scales. Furthermore, in some cases, analyses performed on
              different sets of landscapes provided different results, which
              suggests caution should be used when conservation recommendations
              are applied to disparate areas. Establishment of riparian buffers
              should not be focused only on riparian habitat, but should take a
              landscape perspective because semiaquatic species use multiple
              elements for different functions. This approach can be complex
              because different landscape elements require different spatial
              extents. Nevertheless, a shift of attention toward the management
              of different elements at multiple spatial scales is necessary for
              the long-term persistence of populations.",

              consequences for a declining amphibian",

  abstract = "Trophic linkages between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are
              increasingly recognized as important yet poorly known features of
              food webs. Here we describe research to understand the dynamics
              of lake food webs in relation to a native riparian amphibian and
              its interaction with introduced trout. The mountain yellow-legged
              frog Rana muscosa is endemic to alpine watersheds of the Sierra
              Nevada Mountains and the Transverse Ranges of California, but it
              has declined to a small fraction of its historical distribution
              and abundance. Although remaining frogs and introduced trout feed
              in different habitats of alpine lakes, our stable-isotope
              analyses clearly show that the same resource base of benthic
              invertebrates sustains their growth. During one period, insect
              emergence from naturally fishless lakes was nearly 20-fold higher
              compared to adjacent lakes with trout, showing that fish reduce
              availability of aquatic prey to amphibious and terrestrial
              consumers. Although trout cannot prey on adult frogs due to gape
              limitation, foraging post-metamorphic frogs are 10 times more
              abundant in the absence of trout, suggesting an important role
              for competition for prey by trout in highly unproductive alpine
              watersheds. Most Sierran lakes contain fish, and those that do
              not are usually small isolated ponds; in our study, these two
              lake types supported the lowest densities of post-metamorphic
              frogs, and these frogs were less reliant on local, benthic
              sources of productivity. Since Rana muscosa was formerly the most
              abundant vertebrate in the Sierra Nevada, the reduction in energy
              flow from lake benthos to this consumer due to fish introductions
              may have had negative consequences for its numerous terrestrial
              predators, many of which have also declined. We suggest that
              disruptions of trophic connections between aquatic and
              terrestrial food webs are an important but poorly understood
              consequence of fish introduction to many thousands of montane
              lakes and streams worldwide and may contribute to declines of
              native consumers in riparian habitats.",

              amphibians are particularly likely to be affected by climate

              climate-driven shifts in the distribution of 413 amphibian
              species based on 20 climate simulations for 2071-2100. We
              summarized these projections to produce estimates of species
              turnover. Second, we mapped the distribution of 1099 species with
              restricted geographic ranges. Finally, using the 20 future
              climate-change simulations, we mapped areas that were
              consistently projected to receive less seasonal precipitation in
              the coming century and thus were likely to have altered
              microclimates and local hydrologies. Species turnover was
              projected to be highest in the Andes Mountains and parts of
              Central America and Mexico, where, on average, turnover rates
              exceeded 60\% under the lower of two emissions scenarios. Many of

              projected to experience high species turnover, have many
              additional restricted-range species, and were consistently
              projected to receive less precipitation. Together, our three

              common northeastern North American amphibian species to Bd to
              assess the likelihood of population-level effects from the
              disease. We exposed larval wood frogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) and
              postmetamorphic frogs of six other species to two different
              strains of Bd, a northeastern strain (JEL404) and a strain that
              caused die-offs of amphibians in Panama (JEL423), under ideal in
              vitro growth conditions for Bd. Exposed American toads (Anaxyrus
              americanus) all died; thus, this species may be the most likely
              to die from Bd-caused disease in the wild. Both Bd strains were
              associated with mortalities of wood frogs, although half the
              metamorphs survived. The Bd strain from Panama killed metamorphic
              green frogs (L. clamitans), whereas the northeastern strain did
              not, which means novel strains of Bd may lead to death even when
              local strains may not. No mortality was observed in four species
              (bullfrogs [L. catesbeianus], northern leopard frogs [L.
              pipiens], spring peepers [Pseudacris crucifer], and blue-spotted

              green frogs and wood frogs that we exposed. This finding suggests
              these six species may be Bd vectors. Our results show that
              systematic exposures of amphibian species to Bd in the laboratory
              may be a good first step in the identification of species
              susceptible to Bd-caused declines and in directing regional
              conservation efforts aimed at susceptible species.",

               worldwide likely have important effects on their predators. In
               the Sierra Nevada, where amphibian declines are well documented
               and some are closely tied to the introduction of nonnative
               trout, the mountain garter snake, Thamnophis elegans elegans,
               preys predominately on amphibians. We surveyed 2103
               high-elevation lakes in the Sierra Nevada, quantified the
               distributional relationship between the mountain garter snake
               and anuran amphibians (Pseudacris regilla, Rana muscosa, and
               Bufo spp.) and used this information to evaluate the possibility
               that amphibian declines lead to declines of garter snakes. We
               observed a strong association between amphibian presence and
               garter snake presence. The probability of finding snakes in
               lakes with amphibians was 30 times greater than in lakes without
               amphibians. Lakes with snakes had higher numbers of amphibians
               within 1 km (mean = 4018.8) than did lakes without snakes (mean
               = 642.1). On a landscape scale, in Kings Canyon National Park
               (where 40\% of larger lakes contain nonnative trout) amphibians
               were found in 52\% of lakes, and 62 garter snakes were found in
               33 of the 1059 lakes surveyed. In contrast, in the John Muir
               Wilderness (JMW; where 80\% of larger lakes contain nonnative
               trout), amphibians were found in 19\% of lakes, and no snakes
               were found in any of the 1044 lakes surveyed. Based on these
               data, we suggest that the introduction of nonnative trout has
               led not only to the decline of amphibians but also to the
               decline of garter snakes. This study supports the hypothesis
               that the presence of amphibians is a prerequisite for garter
               snake persistence in high-elevation portions of the Sierra
               Nevada and that the introduction of trout into an ecosystem can
               have serious effects, not just on their prey but also on other

  abstract = "Abstract Hyperpredation occurs when non-native prey facilitate
              invasive predators, which then suppress native prey. Direct
              impacts of introduced fish on amphibians are well studied, but
              the role of fish in supporting shared predators has not been
              considered. We present evidence for indirect effects of trout on
              amphibians through snake predation. Analyses of the diet,
              distribution and density of the Pacific coast aquatic garter
              snake (Thamnophis atratus) relative to the sympatric common
              garter snake (Thamnophis sirtalis) in the Klamath Mountains of
              California suggest that trout introductions facilitated expansion
              of T. atratus by providing alternative prey. T. atratus diet
              included trout and amphibians whereas T. sirtalis preyed solely
              upon amphibians. The distribution and density of T. atratus
              matched that of introduced trout instead of native amphibians.
              Populations of T. atratus could reach high densities in the
              absence of high densities of amphibians. When the snakes
              opportunistically prey upon amphibians whose numbers are already
              directly impacted by trout, they can cause significant additional
              declines. When T. atratus was present in lake basins, native
              Cascades frogs (Rana cascadae) were rarer than in basins without
              T. atratus. This case differs from other hyperpredation studies
              because the two prey species also interact via intraguild
              predation. Given the worldwide practice of stocking fish into
              aquatic habitats, it is important to understand the consequences
              of the practice on food-web structure and ecosystem functioning.
              Bottom-up impacts of introduced predators should be considered as
              well as top-down so that managers can incorporate the range of
              ecosystem-level effects into conservation goals and decisions.",

              amphibians from pathogens linked to global amphibian declines",
  author   = "Rollins-Smith, Louise A",
  abstract = "Amphibian species have experienced population declines and
              extinctions worldwide that are unprecedented in recent history.
              Many of these recent declines have been linked to a pathogenic
              skin fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, or to iridoviruses
              of the genus Ranavirus. One of the first lines of defense against
              pathogens that enter by way of the skin are antimicrobial
              peptides synthesized and stored in dermal granular glands and
              secreted into the mucus following alarm or injury. Here, I review
              what is known about the capacity of amphibian antimicrobial
              peptides from diverse amphibians to inhibit B. dendrobatidis or
              ranavirus infections. When multiple species were compared for the
              effectiveness of their in vitro antimicrobial peptides defenses
              against B. dendrobatidis, non-declining species of rainforest
              amphibians had more effective antimicrobial peptides than species
              in the same habitat that had recently experienced population
              declines. Further, there was a significant correlation between
              the effectiveness of the antimicrobial peptides and resistance of
              the species to experimental infection. These studies support the
              hypothesis that antimicrobial peptides are an important component
              of innate defenses against B. dendrobatidis. Some amphibian
              antimicrobial peptides inhibit ranavirus infections and infection
              of human T lymphocytes by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
              An effective antimicrobial peptide defense against skin pathogens
              appears to depend on a diverse array of genes expressing
              antimicrobial peptides. The production of antimicrobial peptides
              may be regulated by signals from the pathogens. However, this
              defense must also accommodate potentially beneficial microbes on
              the skin that compete or inhibit growth of the pathogens. How
              this delicate balancing act is accomplished is an important area
              of future research.",

              cause host extinctions because the pathogen should fade out when
              the host population is driven below some threshold density. An
              emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, caused by the
              fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is directly
              linked to the recent extinction or serious decline of hundreds of
              amphibian species. Despite continued spread of this pathogen into
              uninfected areas, the dynamics of the host-pathogen interaction
              remain unknown. We use fine-scale spatiotemporal data to describe
              (i) the invasion and spread of Bd through three lake basins, each
              containing multiple populations of the mountain yellow-legged
              frog, and (ii) the accompanying host-pathogen dynamics. Despite
              intensive sampling, Bd was not detected on frogs in study basins
              until just before epidemics began. Following Bd arrival in a
              basin, the disease spread to neighboring populations at
              approximately 700 m/yr in a wave-like pattern until all
              populations were infected. Within a population, infection
              prevalence rapidly reached 100\% and infection intensity on
              individual frogs increased in parallel. Frog mass mortality began
              only when infection intensity reached a critical threshold and
              repeatedly led to extinction of populations. Our results indicate
              that the high growth rate and virulence of Bd allow the
              near-simultaneous infection and buildup of high infection
              intensities in all host individuals; subsequent host population
              crashes therefore occur before Bd is limited by density-dependent
              factors. Preventing infection intensities in host populations
              from reaching this threshold could provide an effective strategy
              to avoid the extinction of susceptible amphibian species in the
              wild.",

              direct and indirect, is having profound effects on natural
              environments. The amphibians--frogs, salamanders, and
              caecilians--may be the only major group currently at risk
              globally. A detailed worldwide assessment and subsequent updates
              show that one-third or more of the 6,300 species are threatened
              with extinction. This trend is likely to accelerate because most
              amphibians occur in the tropics and have small geographic ranges
              that make them susceptible to extinction. The increasing pressure
              from habitat destruction and climate change is likely to have
              major impacts on narrowly adapted and distributed species. We
              show that salamanders on tropical mountains are particularly at
              risk. A new and significant threat to amphibians is a virulent,
              emerging infectious disease, chytridiomycosis, which appears to
              be globally distributed, and its effects may be exacerbated by
              global warming. This disease, which is caused by a fungal
              pathogen and implicated in serious declines and extinctions of
              >200 species of amphibians, poses the greatest threat to
              biodiversity of any known disease. Our data for frogs in the

              in vitro cultures of the fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis,
              the causative agent of chytridiomycosis in amphibians. The aim
              was to evaluate the fungicidal effects of chemical disinfectants,
              sterilising ultraviolet (UV) light, heat and desiccation, using
              methods that were feasible for either disinfection in the field,
              in amphibian husbandry or in the laboratory. The chemical
              disinfectants tested were: sodium chloride, household bleach
              (active ingredient: sodium hypochlorite), potassium permanganate,
              formaldehyde solution, Path-X agricultural disinfectant (active
              ingredient: didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride, DDAC), quaternary
              ammonium compound 128 (DDAC), Dithane, Virkon, ethanol and
              benzalkonium chloride. In 2 series of experiments using separate
              isolates of B. dendrobatidis, the fungicidal effect was evaluated
              for various time periods and at a range of chemical
              concentrations. The end point measured was death of 100\% of
              zoospores and zoosporangia. Nearly all chemical disinfectants
              resulted in 100\%, mortality for at least one of the
              concentrations tested. However, concentration and time of
              exposure was critical for most chemicals. Exposure to 70\%
              ethanol, 1 mg Virkon ml(-1) or 1 mg benzalkonium chloride ml(-1)
              resulted in death of all zoosporangia after 20 s. The most
              effective products for field use were Path-X and the quaternary
              ammonium compound 128, which can be used at dilutions containing
              low levels (e.g. 0.012 or 0.008\%, respectively) of the active
              compound didecyl dimethyl ammonium chloride. Bleach, containing
              the active ingredient sodium hypochlorite, was effective at
              concentrations of 1\% sodium hypochlorite and above. Cultures did
              not survive complete drying, which occurred after <3 h at room
              temperature. B. dendrobatidis was sensitive to heating, and
              within 4 h at 37 degrees C, 30 min at 47 degrees C and 5 min at
              60 degrees C, 100\% mortality occurred. UV light (at 1000 mW

               of many terrestrial organisms because it can influence foraging
               time, limit dispersal, and curtail courtship activities. Water
               loss can vary in time and space across the landscape, and can
               also be modulated by behavior. Amphibians are particularly
               sensitive to water loss because their skin provides little to no
               resistance to evaporative water loss. Our study sought to
               quantify rates of water loss across a heterogeneous landscape
               using plaster of Paris models as analogues for the Western Slimy
               Salamander (Plethodon albagula Grobman, 1944). Models were
               validated within a controlled laboratory setting prior to field
               deployment, and were shown to approximate rates and magnitudes
               of water loss observed in living salamanders. In the field, we
               tested both adult- and juvenile-sized models, and found that
               juvenile-sized models lost water at a greater rate under all
               contexts. The rates of water loss measured at night
               (1.5\%/h?4.5\%/h) was nearly half of those measured during the
               day (2\%/h?10\%/h). Rates of water loss were greatest on ridges
               with southwestern aspects during the day (5\%/h?10\%/h) and
               lowest in ravines with northeast aspects at night

               patterns of water loss corroborate field observations of
               salamander activity patterns and distribution across the
               landscape, providing a physiological mechanism driving
               fine-scale habitat use and distribution. Although we tested
               plaster models as analogues for salamanders, this approach
               should be generalizable to other amphibian taxa, providing an

              great utility for species identification and discovery in an

              its application to one of the most taxonomically diverse
              vertebrate groups - the amphibians. Here, we test three of the
              perceived shortcomings of a CO1 DNA barcode's utility with a
              group of Holarctic amphibians: primer fit, sequence variability
              and overlapping intra- and interspecific variability. We found
              that although the CO1 DNA barcode priming regions were variable,
              we were able to reliably amplify a CO1 fragment from degenerate
              primers and primers with G-C residues at the 3' end. Any overlap
              between intra- and interspecific variation in our taxonomic
              sampling was due to introgressive hybridization (Bufo/Anaxyrus),
              complex genetics (Ambystoma) or incomplete taxonomy (Triturus).
              Rates of hybridization and species discovery are not expected to
              be greater for amphibians than for other vertebrate groups, and
              thus problems with the utility of using a single mitochondrial
              gene for species identification will not be specific to
              amphibians. Therefore, we conclude that there is greater
              potential for a CO1 barcode's use with amphibians than has been
              reported to date. A large-scale effort to barcode the amphibians

              provide a useful, standardized tool for species identification in

              amphibian and 17 reptile species were used to generate barcode
              sequences using partial sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome
              c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and to compare it with other
              suggested barcode loci. Comparing 16S rRNA, cytochrome b (Cytb)
              and COI for amphibians and 12S rRNA, Cytb and COI for reptiles,
              our results revealed that COI is better than the other markers in

              variation and moderate amplification success. Although the COI

              intraspecific variation, all of the analysed individuals from the
              same species clustered together in a neighbour-joining tree. High
              intraspecific variation suggests the possibility of cryptic
              species. Finally, using this database, confiscated snakes were
              identified as Elaphe schrenckii, designated as endangered in

              species are typically old, strongly divergent, and contain deep
              conspecific lineages which might lead to problems in species
              assignment with incomplete reference databases. As far as known,
              there is no single pair of COI primers that will guarantee a
              sufficient rate of success across all amphibian and reptile taxa,
              or within major subclades of amphibians and reptiles, which means
              that the PCR amplification strategy needs to be adjusted
              depending on the specific research question. In general, many
              more amphibian and reptile taxa have been sequenced for 16S rDNA,

              annual egg-mass counts of the Columbia spotted frog (Rana
              luteiventris) across the northwestern United States, an area
              encompassing 3 genetic clades. On the basis of data collected by
              multiple partners from 98 water bodies between 1991 and 2011, we
              used state-space and linear-regression models to measure effects
              of patch characteristics, frequency of summer drought, and
              wetland restoration on population growth. Abundance increased in
              the 2 clades with greatest decline history, but declined where
              populations are considered most secure. Population growth was
              negatively associated with temporary hydroperiods and landscape
              modification (measured by the human footprint index), but was
              similar in modified and natural water bodies. The effect of
              drought was mediated by the size of the water body: populations
              in large water bodies maintained positive growth despite drought,
              whereas drought magnified declines in small water bodies. Rapid
              growth in restored wetlands in areas of historical population
              declines provided strong evidence of successful management. Our
              results highlight the importance of maintaining large areas of
              habitat and underscore the greater vulnerability of small areas
              of habitat to environmental stochasticity. Similar long-term
              growth rates in modified and natural water bodies and rapid,
              positive responses to restoration suggest pond construction and
              other forms of management can effectively increase population

  abstract = "Increasing habitat fragmentation poses an immediate threat to
              population viability, as gene flow patterns are changed in these
              altered landscapes. Patterns of genetic divergence can
              potentially reveal the impact of these shifts in landscape
              connectivity. However, divergence patterns not only carry the
              signature of altered contemporary landscapes, but also historical
              ones. When considered separately, both recent and historical
              landscape structure appear to significantly affect connectivity
              among 51 wood frog (Rana sylvatica) populations. However, by
              controlling for correlations among landscape structure from
              multiple time periods, we show that patterns of genetic
              divergence reflect recent landscape structure as opposed to
              landscape structure prior to European settlement of the region
              (before 1850s). At the same time, within-population genetic
              diversities remain high and a genetic signature of population
              bottlenecks is lacking. Together, these results suggest that
              metapopulation processes - not drift-induced divergence
              associated with strong demographic bottlenecks following habitat
              loss - underlie the strikingly rapid consequences of temporally

              the breath of their TPCs by shifting their upper limits with
              respect to when they were acclimated at 10°C. In addition, even

  abstract = "Anthropogenic climate change will present both opportunities and
              challenges for pool-breeding amphibians. Increased water
              temperature and accelerated drying may directly affect larval
              growth, development, and survival, yet the combined effects of
              these processes on larvae with future climate change remain
              poorly understood. Increased surface temperatures are projected
              to warm water and decrease water inputs, leading to earlier and
              faster wetland drying. So it is often assumed that larvae will
              experience negative synergistic impacts with combined warming and
              drying. However, an alternative hypothesis is that
              warming-induced increases in metabolic rate and aquatic resource
              availability might compensate for faster drying rates, generating
              antagonistic larval responses. We conducted a mesocosm experiment
              to test the individual and interactive effects of pool permanency
              (permanent vs. temporary) and water temperature (ambient vs. (+)
              -3 degrees C) on three anurans with fast-to-slow larval
              development rates (Great Basin spadefoot [Spea intermontana],
              Pacific chorus frog [Pseudacris regilla], and northern red-legged
              frog [Rana aurora]). We found that although tadpoles in warmed
              pools reached metamorphosis 15-17 days earlier, they did so with
              little cost (< 2 mm) to size, likely due to greater periphyton
              growth in warmed pools easing drying-induced resource
              competition. Warming and drying combined to act antagonistically
              on early growth (P = 0.06) and survival (P = 0.06), meaning the
              combined impact was less than the sum of the individual impacts.
              Warming and drying acted additively on time to and size at
              metamorphosis. These nonsynergistic impacts may result from
              cotolerance of larvae to warming and drying, as well as warming
              helping to offset negative impacts of drying. Our results
              indicate that combined pool warming and drying may not always be
              harmful for larval amphibians. However, they also demonstrate
              that antagonistic responses are difficult to predict, which poses
              a challenge to proactive conservation and management. Our study
              highlights the importance of considering the nature of multiple

              breeding populations (N = 20 and 26) of these species in a

              lines (P < 0.01). After testing for autocorrelation among genetic

              landscape resistance based on slope, soil type, solar insolation,

              provided the least resistance, while agriculture and
              shrub/clearcut provided the least resistance for Columbia spotted
              frogs. Comparative landscape genetics can be a powerful tool for
              detecting similarities and differences between codistributed

               oviposition site selection and toxicity of road salt to
               embryonic Cope's Gray Treefrogs (Hyla chrysoscelis). We
               simulated road-salt stratification in 7-L microcosms containing
               sediment from a salt-contaminated pond and placed developing
               eggs at three water depths and directly on the sediment of the
               microcosms. At the beginning of the experiment, conductivity at
               the bottom of the microcosms was four to seven (from ?4.0 to 6.5
               mS cm?1) times higher than at the top or middle of the water
               column (?1.0 mS cm?1). Subsequently, survival of eggs placed
               near the bottom and on the bottom of buckets containing
               salt-contaminated sediment was near 0\%, while survival of eggs
               at the top and middle depths of the contaminated microcosms, and
               at all depths in control microcosms, was >60\%. After hatching,
               embryos avoided the bottom of contaminated buckets even though
               much of the vertical salt gradient had dissipated. In contrast,
               embryos in control buckets clustered at the bottom. Our results
               suggest that pond-breeding amphibians that place their eggs away
               from the bottom may avoid some of the toxic effects of salt
               contamination, and those that place eggs on the bottom may be at
               particularly high risk.",

  abstract = "One of the main questions in evolutionary and conservation
              biology is how geographical and environmental features of the
              landscape shape neutral and adaptive genetic variation in natural
              populations. The identification of genomic polymorphisms that
              account for adaptive variation can aid in finding candidate loci
              for local adaptation. Consequently, a comparison of spatial
              patterns in neutral markers and loci under selection may help
              disentangle the effects of gene flow, genetic drift and selection
              at the landscape scale. Many amphibians breed in wetlands, which
              differ in environmental conditions and in the degree of
              isolation, enhancing the potential for local adaptation. We used
              microsatellite markers to measure genetic differentiation among
              17 local populations of Rana arvalis breeding in a network of
              wetlands. We found that locus RC08604 deviated from neutral
              expectations, suggesting that it is a good candidate for
              directional selection. We used a genetic network analysis to show
              that the allele distribution in this locus is correlated with
              habitat characteristics, whereas this was not the case at neutral
              markers that displayed a different allele distribution and
              population network in the study area. The graph approach
              illustrated the genomic heterogeneity (neutral loci vs. the
              candidate locus for directional selection) of gene exchange and
              genetic divergence among populations under directional selection.
              Limited gene flow between wetlands was only observed at the
              candidate genomic region under directional selection. RC08604 is
              partially located inside an up-regulated thyroid-hormone receptor
              (TR$\beta$) gene coordinating the expression of other genes
              during metamorphosis and appears to be linked with variation in
              larval life-history traits found among R. arvalis populations. We
              suggest that directional selection on genes coding larval
              life-history traits is strong enough to maintain the divergence
              in these genomic regions, reducing the effective recombination of
              locally adapted alleles but not in other regions of the genome.
              Integrating this knowledge into conservation plans at the
              landscape scale will improve the design of management strategies
              to preserve adaptive genetic diversity in wetland networks.",

              advancement, and amphibians are among the taxa showing the
              strongest phenological responsiveness to warming temperatures.
              Amphibians are strongly influenced by climate change, but we do
              not have a clear picture of how climate influences important
              parameters of amphibian populations, such as abundance, survival,
              breeding success and morphology. Furthermore, the relative impact
              of temperature and precipitation change remains underappreciated.
              We used Bayesian meta-analysis and meta-regression to quantify
              the impact of temperature and precipitation change on amphibian
              phenology, abundance, individual features and performance. We
              obtained effect sizes from studies performed in five continents.
              Temperature increase was the major driver of phenological
              advancement, while the impact of precipitation on phenology was
              weak. Conversely, population dynamics was mostly determined by
              precipitation: negative trends were associated with drying
              regimes. The impact of precipitation on abundance was
              particularly strong in tropical areas, while the importance of
              temperature was feeble. Both temperature and precipitation
              influenced parameters representing breeding performance,
              morphology, developmental rate and survival, but the response was
              highly heterogeneous among species. For instance, warming
              temperature increased body size in some species, and decreased
              size in others. Similarly, rainy periods increased survival of
              some species and reduced the survival of others. Our study showed
              contrasting impacts of temperature and precipitation changes on
              amphibian populations. Both climatic parameters strongly
              influenced amphibian performance, but temperature was the major
              determinant of the phenological changes, while precipitation had
              the major role on population dynamics, with alarming declines

  abstract = "Global climate change has been implicated in phenological shifts
              for a variety of taxa. Amphibian species in particular are
              sensitive to changes in their environment due to their biphasic
              life history and restricted reproductive requirements. Previous
              research has shown that not all temperate amphibian species
              respond similarly to the same suite of climatic or environmental
              cues, nor are individual species necessarily uniform in their
              responses across their range. We examined both the timing of
              spring emergence and calling phenology of eight anuran species in
              southeastern Ontario, Canada, using an approximately 40-year
              dataset of historical records of amphibian activity. Rana pipiens
              was the only species out of eight considered to emerge
              significantly earlier, by an estimated 22 days over four decades.
              Both R. pipiens and Bufo americanus have advanced initiation of
              calling over a four-decade span significantly earlier by an
              estimated 37.2 and 19.2 days, respectively. Rana sylvatica showed
              a trend toward earlier emergence by 19 days, whereas we did not
              detect changes in emergence phenology for the remaining five
              species. This significant shift in breeding behavior for two
              species correlates to significant regional increases in spring
              temperatures of an estimated 2.7-2.8°C overall over four decades.
              Our study suggests that local temperature increases have affected
              the timing of emergence and the onset of calling activity in some
              Ontario anuran species. Global decline or range shifts ultimately
              may be related to changes in reproductive behavior and timing

              microparasite infections and the resulting consequences,
              comparatively little research has addressed such questions for
              amphibian macroparasites. What work has been done in this area
              has largely focused on nematodes of the genus Rhabdias and on two
              genera of trematodes (Ribeiroia and Echinostoma). Here, we
              provide a synopsis of amphibian macroparasites, explore how
              macroparasites may affect amphibian hosts and populations, and
              evaluate the significance of these parasites in larger community
              and ecosystem contexts. In addition, we consider environmental
              influences on amphibian-macroparasite interactions by exploring
              contemporary ecological factors known or hypothesized to affect
              patterns of infection. While some macroparasites of amphibians
              have direct negative effects on individual hosts, no studies have
              explicitly examined whether such infections can affect amphibian
              populations. Moreover, due to their complex life cycles and
              varying degrees of host specificity, amphibian macroparasites
              have rich potential as bioindicators of environmental
              modifications, especially providing insights into changes in food
              webs. Because of their documented pathologies and value as
              bioindicators, we emphasize the need for broader investigation of
              this understudied group, noting that ecological drivers affecting

              move through altered habitats likely depends on the level of
              contrast between natural forest and surrounding land uses.
              Connectivity models, such as circuit theory models, are widely
              used in conservation biology, and their primary input consists of
              resistance surfaces representing movement costs associated with
              landscape features. Cost values are most frequently determined by
              expert opinion, which may not capture relevant levels of contrast
              among features. We developed resistance surfaces using
              experiments that represent different local mechanisms
              hypothesized to affect connectivity for two Neotropical amphibian
              species. Response ratios were calculated to translate
              experimental results to cost values used in connectivity
              modeling. We used relative abundance data in three land-cover
              types to generate resistance surfaces for evaluating independent
              support of models derived from experiments. Finally, we analyzed
              agreement among movement pathways predicted for each species and
              among three commonly used connectivity measures: Euclidean, least
              cost, and resistance distances. Experiments showed that extreme
              microclimates associated with altered habitats significantly
              increased desiccation and mortality risk for both species.
              Resistances estimated from microclimate experiments were
              concordant with those from survey data for both species. For one
              focal species, resistance estimates derived from predator
              encounter rates were also highly correlated with
              abundance-derived resistances. There was generally low agreement

              the importance of choosing connectivity models that are most
              appropriate for the study objectives. Overall, similarity among
              linkages modeled for each species was high, but decreased with
              declining forest cover. Our results highlight the value of
              experiments for drawing inferences about processes in resistance
              modeling, as well as the need to consider model differences and

              through February pre-breeding and breeding periods. Additionally,
              two winter-breeding species in the same community are breeding
              increasingly earlier. Four of the 10 species studied have shifted
              their reproductive timing an estimated 15.3 to 76.4 days in the
              past 30 years. This has resulted in rates of phenological change
              that range from 5.9 to 37.2 days per decade, providing examples
              of some of the greatest rates of changing phenology in ecological
              events reported to date. Owing to the opposing direction of the
              shifts in reproductive timing, our results suggest an alteration
              in the degree of temporal niche overlap experienced by amphibian
              larvae in this community. Reproductive timing can drive community
              dynamics in larval amphibians and our results identify an
              important pathway by which climate change may affect amphibian
              communities.",

  abstract = "As organisms living in temperate environments often have only a
              short time window for growth and reproduction, their life-history
              strategies are expected to be influenced by these time
              constraints. Parents may alter the pace of offspring life-history
              as a response to changes in breeding phenology. However, the
              responses to changes in time constraints must be balanced with
              those against other stressors, such as predation, one of the
              strongest and more ubiquitous selective factors in nature. Here,
              after experimentally modifying the timing of breeding and
              hatching in the moor frog (Rana arvalis), we studied how
              compensatory responses to delayed breeding and hatching affect
              antipredator strategies in amphibian larvae. We examined the
              activity patterns, morphology and life-history responses in
              tadpoles exposed to different combinations of breeding and
              hatching delays in the presence and absence of predators. We
              found clear evidence of adaptive transgenerational effects since
              tadpoles from delayed breeding treatments increased growth and
              development independently of predation risk. The presence of
              predators reduced tadpole activity, tadpoles from delayed
              breeding treatments maintaining lower activity than non-delayed
              ones also in the absence of predators. Tadpoles reared with
              predators developed deeper tails and bodies, however, tadpoles
              from breeding delay treatments had reduced morphological defenses
              as compared to non-delayed individuals. No significant effects of
              hatching delay were detected in this study. Our study reveals
              that amphibian larvae exposed to breeding delay develop
              compensatory life-history responses even under predation risk,
              but these responses trade-off with the development of
              morphological antipredator defenses. These results suggest that
              under strong time constraints organisms are selected to develop
              fast growth and development responses, and rely on lower activity
              rates as their main antipredator defense. Examining how responses
              to changes in phenology affect species interactions is highly
              relevant for better understanding ecological responses to climate

              yet amphibians have received little attention in this respect. To
              identify possible signatures of adaptation to altitude, we
              performed a genome scan of 15 557 single nucleotide polymorphisms
              (SNPs) obtained with restriction site-associated DNA sequencing
              of pooled samples from 11 populations of Andrew's toad (Bufo
              andrewsi) from the edge of the Tibetan Plateau, spanning an
              altitudinal gradient from 1690 to 2768 m.a.s.l. We discovered
              significant geographic differentiation among all sites, with an
              average FST = 0.023 across all SNPs. Apart from clear patterns of
              isolation by distance, we discovered numerous outlier SNPs
              showing strong associations with variation in altitude (1394
              SNPs), average annual temperature (1859 SNPs) or both (1051
              SNPs). Levels and patterns of genetic differentiation in these
              SNPs were consistent with the hypothesis that they have been
              subject to directional selection and reflect adaptation to
              altitudinal variation among the study sites. Genes with
              footprints of selection were significantly enriched in binding

              is promoted by environmental heterogeneity, strong local
              selection and restricted gene flow. High gene flow, on the other
              hand, is expected to homogenize genetic variation among
              populations and therefore prevent local adaptation. Understanding
              how local adaptation can persist at the spatial scale at which
              gene flow occurs has remained an elusive goal, especially for
              wild vertebrate populations. Here, we explore the roles of
              natural selection and nonrandom gene flow (isolation by breeding
              time and habitat choice) in restricting effective migration among
              local populations and promoting generalized genetic barriers to
              neutral gene flow. We examined these processes in a network of 17
              breeding ponds of the moor frog Rana arvalis, by combining
              environmental field data, a common garden experiment and data on
              variation in neutral microsatellite loci and in a thyroid hormone
              receptor (TR$\beta$) gene putatively under selection. We
              illustrate the connection between genotype, phenotype and habitat
              variation and demonstrate that the strong differences in larval
              life history traits observed in the common garden experiment can
              result from adaptation to local pond characteristics. Remarkably,
              we found that haplotype variation in the TR$\beta$ gene
              contributes to variation in larval development time and growth
              rate, indicating that polymorphism in the TR$\beta$ gene is
              linked with the phenotypic variation among the environments.
              Genetic distance in neutral markers was correlated with
              differences in breeding time and environmental differences among
              the ponds, but not with geographical distance. These results
              demonstrate that while our study area did not exceed the scale of
              gene flow, ecological barriers constrained gene flow among
              contrasting habitats. Our results highlight the roles of strong
              selection and nonrandom gene flow created by phenological
              variation and, possibly, habitat preferences, which together
              maintain genetic and phenotypic divergence at a fine-grained

              ability determines the spatial scale at which landscape
              complementation operates, the factors influencing migratory
              success of amphibians, especially of juveniles, are poorly

              juvenile amphibians possess any innate, long-distance orientation
              mechanisms that might improve their chances of locating suitable
              terrestrial habitat. I conducted experimental releases of spotted
              salamanders (Ambystoma maculatum) and American toads (Bufo
              americanus) from 18 artificial pools in replicate pastures at
              distances of 5-50 In from the nearest forest edges. Using
              circular drift fences with pitfall traps, I captured,
              individually marked, and released metamorphosed salamanders (n =
              323) and toads (n = 203) leaving each pool. Salamanders exhibited
              nonrandom orientation at nine pools, but at only one was the mean
              movement direction consistent with the direction to the nearest
              forest edge. Emigrating salamanders probably responded to
              microtopographic or other distinct features of each pool, rather
              than to distant cues. Migratory success was determined by
              recaptures of marked juveniles at drift fences along the forest
              edges. I used logistic regression to model probability of
              recapture and evaluated alternative models using an
              information-theoretic approach. Migratory success of both species
              was primarily a function of distance to nearest forest. Of
              salamanders and toads released from 50-m pools, < 15\% reached
              the forest, suggesting that few juvenile amphibians would be able
              to migrate greater distances across pastures. Breeding sites
              lacking connectivity to suitable terrestrial habitat may be
              population sinks due to high mortality of juveniles during
              emigration. Additional research is needed to determine
              appropriate threshold distances between breeding sites and

              100 species of Rana rely on an understanding of the evolutionary
              history and patterns of diversification of the group. We estimate
              a well-resolved, time-calibrated phylogeny from sequences of six
              nuclear and three mitochondrial loci sampled from most species of
              Rana, and use that phylogeny to clarify the group's
              diversification and global biogeography. Our analyses
              consistently support an ``Out of Asia'' pattern with two
              independent dispersals of Rana from East Asia to North America
              via Beringian land bridges. The more species-rich lineage of New
              World Rana appears to have experienced a rapid radiation
              following its colonization of the New World, especially with its
              expansion into montane and tropical areas of Mexico, Central
              America, and South America. In contrast, Old World Rana exhibit
              different trajectories of diversification; diversification in the
              Old World began very slowly and later underwent a distinct
              increase in speciation rate around 29-18 Ma. Net diversification
              is associated with environmental changes and especially intensive
              tectonic movements along the Asian margin from the Oligocene to
              early Miocene. Our phylogeny further suggests that previous
              classifications were misled by morphological homoplasy and
              plesiomorphic color patterns, as well as a reliance primarily on
              mitochondrial genes. We provide a phylogenetic taxonomy based on
              analyses of multiple nuclear and mitochondrial gene loci.

               We studied stream temperatures in relation to wildfire in small
               streams in the Boise River Basin, located in central Idaho, USA.
               To examine the spatio-temporal aspects of temperature in
               relation to wildfire, we employed three approaches: a pre--post
               fire comparison of temperatures between two sites (one from a
               burned stream and one unburned) over 13 years, a short-term (3
               year) pre--post fire comparison of a burned and unburned stream
               with spatially extensive data, and a short-term (1 year)
               comparative study of spatial variability in temperatures using a
               ``space for time'' substitutive design across 90 sites in nine
               streams (retrospective comparative study). The latter design
               included streams with a history of stand-replacing wildfire and
               streams with severe post-fire reorganization of channels due to
               debris flows and flooding. Results from these three studies
               indicated that summer maximum water temperatures can remain
               significantly elevated for at least a decade following wildfire,
               particularly in streams with severe channel reorganization. In
               the retrospective comparative study we investigated occurrence
               of native rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and tailed frog
               larvae (Ascaphus montanus) in relation to maximum stream
               temperatures during summer. Both occurred in nearly every site
               sampled, but tailed frog larvae were found in much warmer water
               than previously reported in the field (26.6°C maximum summer
               temperature). Our results show that physical stream habitats can
               remain altered (for example, increased temperature) for many
               years following wildfire, but that native aquatic vertebrates
               can be resilient. In a management context, this suggests
               wildfire may be less of a threat to native species than human
               influences that alter the capacity of stream-living vertebrates

  abstract = "The disappearance of amphibian populations from seemingly
              pristine upland areas worldwide has become a major focus of
              conservation efforts in the last two decades, and a parasitic
              chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, is thought to be
              the causative agent of the population declines. We examined the
              altitudinal distribution of chytrid infections in three
              stream-dwelling frog species (Litoria wilcoxii, L. pearsoniana
              and L. chloris) in southeast Queensland, Australia, and
              hypothesized that if B. dendrobatidis were responsible for the
              disappearance of high-altitude frog populations, infection
              prevalence and intensity would be greatest at higher altitudes.
              Overall, 37.7\% of the 798 adult frogs we sampled were infected
              with B. dendrobatidis, and infections were found in all the
              populations we examined. Contrary to our initial hypothesis, we
              found no consistent evidence that high-altitude frogs were more
              likely to be infected than were lowland frogs. Further, the
              intensity of fungal infections (number of zoospores) on
              high-altitude frogs did not differ significantly from that of
              lowland frogs. Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis appears to be
              capable of infecting frogs at all altitudes in the subtropics,
              suggesting that all populations are at risk of decline when
              conditions favour disease outbreaks. We did find evidence,
              however, that chytrid infections persist longer into summer in
              upland as compared with lowland areas, suggesting that montane
              amphibian populations remain susceptible to disease outbreaks for
              longer periods than do lowland populations. Further, we found
              that at high altitudes, temperatures optimal for chytrid growth
              and reproduction coincide with frog metamorphosis, the life-stage
              at which frogs are most susceptible to chytrid infections. While
              these altitudinal differences may account for the differential
              population-level responses to the presence of B. dendrobatidis,
              the reason why many of southeast Queensland's montane frog

  abstract = "Many investigators have hypothesized that landscape attributes
              such as the amount and proximity of habitat are important for
              amphibian spatial patterns. This has produced a number of studies
              focusing on the effects of landscape characteristics on amphibian
              patterns of occurrence in patches or ponds, most of which
              conclude that the landscape is important. We identified two
              concerns associated with these studies: one deals with their
              applicability to other landscape types, as most have been
              conducted in agricultural landscapes; the other highlights the
              need to account for the probability of detection. We tested the
              hypothesis that landscape characteristics influence spatial
              patterns of amphibian occurrence at ponds after accounting for
              the probability of detection in little-studied peatland
              landscapes undergoing peat mining. We also illustrated the costs
              of not accounting for the probability of detection by comparing
              our results to conventional logistic regression analyses. Results
              indicate that frog occurrence increased with the percent cover of
              ponds within 100, 250, and 1000 m, as well as the amount of
              forest cover within 1000 m. However, forest cover at 250 m had a
              negative influence on frog presence at ponds. Not accounting for
              the probability of detection resulted in underestimating the
              influence of most variables on frog occurrence, whereas a few
              were overestimated. Regardless, we show that conventional
              logistic regression can lead to different conclusions than
              analyses accounting for detectability. Our study is consistent
              with the hypothesis that landscape characteristics are important
              in determining the spatial patterns of frog occurrence at ponds.
              We strongly recommend estimating the probability of detection in
              field surveys, as this will increase the quality and conservation

              amphibian abnormalities to chemically contaminated areas, but
              inference about causal mechanisms is lacking. Here we use a high
              incidence of abnormalities in Alaskan wood frogs to strengthen

              resulting in more injuries to developing limbs and subsequent
              developmental malformations. We evaluated a variety of putative
              causes of frog abnormalities at 21 wetlands on the Kenai National

               habitat use. Individual frogs were continuously tracked for up
               to 16 months. Some individuals remained at breeding ponds all
               year, but 66\% of female and 25\% of male frogs moved to
               nonbreeding areas, even when the breeding site retained water.
               Frogs at our main study site moved 150 m (median), roughly the
               distance to the nearest suitable nonbreeding area. The greatest
               straight-line distance traveled was 1.4 km, although the
               presumed distance traveled was 2.8 km. Females were more likely
               than males to move from permanent ponds (38\% of females, 16\%
               of males), but among dispersing frogs, males and females did not
               differ in distance moved. Some frogs left breeding sites shortly

              populations of northern leopard frogs, Rana pipiens, from Arizona
              and southern Utah using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
              analyses. Fourteen arbitrarily designed primers detected 38
              polymorphic loci in 85 individual frogs. Three types of
              population structure were observed in this study. (i) Two
              populations showed low genetic diversity (D = 0.10 and 0.04) and
              may have been established by relatively recent events. (ii) Two
              were not genetically distinct and exhibited a high degree of
              within-population diversity (D = 0.35). The possibility of gene
              flow between these populations is high due to their geographical
              proximity and their shared genetic structure. (iii) Three
              populations were genetically distinct from each other and the
              other populations, and exhibited intermediate within-population
              variation (D = 0.19, 0.17, 0.14). Genetic distances among the
              seven populations ranged from 0.00 to 0.20, suggesting that some
              of these leopard frog populations are genetically distinct.

              amphibians. Demographic analyses with mark-recapture data allow
              researchers to assess the relative importance of survival, local
              recruitment, and migration to changes in population densities. I
              conducted a 4-year, replicated whole-lake experiment in the
              Klamath Mountains of northern California (U.S.A.) to quantify
              changes in population density, survival, population growth rate,
              and recruitment of the Cascades frog (Rana cascadae) in response
              to manipulations of non-native fish populations. I compared
              responses of the frogs in lakes where fish were removed, in lakes
              in their naturally fish-free state, and in lakes where fish
              remained that were either stocked annually or no longer being
              stocked. Within 3 years of fish removals from 3 lakes, frog
              densities increased by a factor of 13.6. The survival of young
              adult frogs increased from 59\% to 94\%, and realized population
              growth and recruitment rates at the fish-removal lakes were more
              than twice as high as the rates for fish-free reference lakes and
              lakes that contained fish. Population growth in the fish-removal
              lakes was likely due to better on-site recruitment of frogs to
              later life stages rather than increased immigration. The effects
              on R. cascadae of suspending stocking were ambiguous and
              suggested no direct benefit to amphibians. With amphibians
              declining worldwide, these results show that active restoration

              breeding ponds in western Montana and Idaho, USA, in order to
              investigate the effects of landscape structure on patterns of
              gene flow. We were particularly interested in addressing three
              questions: (i) do ridges act as barriers to gene flow? (ii) is
              gene flow restricted between low and high elevation ponds? (iii)
              does a pond equal a 'randomly mating population' (a deme)? We
              found that mountain ridges and elevational differences were
              associated with increased genetic differentiation among sites,
              suggesting that gene flow is restricted by ridges and elevation

              spotted frogs generally include more than a single pond except

              high levels of gene flow among low elevation sites separated by
              large distances. Moreover, genetic variation within populations
              was strongly negatively correlated with elevation, suggesting
              effective population sizes are much smaller at high elevation

               the most affected groups. The causes of global amphibian
               population declines and extinctions are varied, complex and
               context-dependent and may involve multiple stressors. However,
               experimental studies examining multiple factors contributing to
               amphibian population declines are rare. 2. Using outdoor
               mesocosms containing zooplankton, phytoplankton, periphyton and
               tadpoles, we conducted a 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 3 factorial

               dendrobatidis (Bd) on three different assemblages of larval
               pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) and Cascades frogs (Rana

               affected by carbaryl and the amphibian assemblage treatment, but
               only minimally by Bd. Carbaryl delayed metamorphosis in both
               amphibian species and increased the growth rate of P. regilla.
               Carbaryl also reduced cladoceran abundance, which, in turn, had
               positive effects on phytoplankton abundance but no effect on
               periphyton biomass. Substituting 20 intraspecific competitors
               with 20 interspecific competitors decreased the larval period
               but not the growth rate of P. regilla. In contrast, substituting
               20 intraspecific competitors with 20 interspecific competitors
               had no effect on R. cascadae. Results of real-time quantitative
               polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis confirmed infection of
               Bd-exposed animals, but exposure to Bd had no effects on either
               species in univariate analyses, although it had significant or
               nearly significant effects in several multivariate analyses. In
               short, we found no interactive effects among the treatments on

               and feeding. To quantify site fidelity, the tendency to return
               to and reuse previously occupied habitats, we used multistrata
               models (with water bodies as the strata) and potential function
               analyses. The probability of returning to previously used water
               bodies during all activity periods was typically greater than
               80\% and always greater than the probability of moving to other
               water bodies. Site fidelity models (with lake-specific movement

               disturbances in high-elevation Sierra Nevada lakes (exotic

               frogs return to lakes subject to drying or those with fish

              (1st--4th-order) streams in the Boreal Foothills of west-central
              Alberta. Anuran call surveys indicated that beaver create

              maculata), wood frog (Rana sylvatica) and western toad (Bufo
              boreas). No calling males of any species were recorded on

              exhibited high rates of juvenile recruitment on beaver ponds.
              Pitfall traps captured more wood frogs on beaver ponds versus
              unobstructed streams, and most individuals (84\%) were
              young-of-year. Abundance of young-of-year was strongly correlated
              with percent landscape occupied by beaver ponds indicating that
              anurans captured along streams originated in beaver ponds. Based
              on a novel combination of a digital elevation model and aerial

               25°C) in laboratory to investigate their growth and development
               responses to temperature variation. In general, larvae exposed
               to warmer temperature experienced higher survival and
               metamorphosed faster, but at a smaller size than those at low
               temperature. We found differences among the populations in both

              Glacier National Park (Montana, U.S.A.), where we have conducted
              long-term monitoring of amphibians. We measured responses of 3
              amphibian species to fires of different sizes, severity, and age
              in a small geographic area with uniform management. We used data
              from wetlands associated with 6 wildfires that burned between
              1988 and 2003 to evaluate whether burn extent and severity and
              interactions between wildfire and wetland isolation affected the
              distribution of breeding populations. We measured responses with
              models that accounted for imperfect detection to estimate
              occupancy during prefire (0-4 years) and different postfire
              recovery periods. For the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma
              macrodactylum) and Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris),
              occupancy was not affected for 6 years after wildfire. But 7-21
              years after wildfire, occupancy for both species decreased $\geq$
              25\% in areas where >50\% of the forest within 500 m of wetlands
              burned. In contrast, occupancy of the boreal toad (Anaxyrus
              boreas) tripled in the 3 years after low-elevation forests
              burned. This increase in occupancy was followed by a gradual
              decline. Our results show that accounting for magnitude of change
              and time lags is critical to understanding population dynamics of
              amphibians after large disturbances. Our results also inform
              understanding of the potential threat of increases in wildfire
              frequency or severity to amphibians in the region.",

              Yosemite Toad (Anaxyrus [Bufo] canorus) on national forest lands

              We conducted monitoring at extensive (rangewide) and intensive
              (individual population) scales with small watersheds (2-4 km(2)),
              individual meadows, and breeding areas within meadows as sample
              units. Yosemite Toad breeding was found in an estimated
              proportion of 0.84 +/- 0.03 (SE) of recently occupied watersheds
              (locality data from 1990-2001), and 0.13 +/- 0.04 of historically
              occupied watersheds (locality data prior to 1990). Rangewide,
              breeding was found in an estimated proportion of 0.22 +/- 0.01 of
              watersheds. We quantified demographic parameters (abundance and
              survival of breeding males, abundance of egg masses, successful
              metamorphosis) in six meadows in two watersheds. Abundances were
              small, with the largest populations having only 16-21 and 18-19
              breeding males each year. Annual survival rates of males by
              meadow ranged from 0.49-0.72. Numbers of egg masses per year were
              low, and the proportion of breeding areas with successful
              metamorphosis ranged from 0.14-0.73. Using the multi-scale data,
              we examined Yosemite Toad spatial and temporal occupancy
              patterns. Yosemite Toads tended to breed in one or two sites
              (lakes, meadows, stream reaches) per watershed every year, and
              occasionally in other sites. This assessment of the status of the

               by mammals, they have not been used to document amphibian
               movements. We installed four amphibian tunnels in Waterton Lakes
               National Park, Alberta, Canada to reduce road mortality in a
               declining population of Long-toed Salamanders (Ambystoma

               amphibians. We installed digital cameras on the ceilings of
               tunnel entrances to monitor tunnel floors. Cameras were set to
               take motion-triggered images and timed-interval images (1
               photograph/minute from 2100-0600). We installed one pitfall trap
               at each tunnel exit to capture amphibians travelling through
               tunnels and assess camera performance. From May through August
               2009, we captured 104 adult A. macrodactylum in traps, but only
               58 crossings were documented by cameras, indicating that cameras
               missed at least 46 salamander crossings. Ambystoma macrodactylum
               failed to trigger motion detectors during 81.0\% of the
               camera-documented tunnel crossings. Cameras revealed that
               salamanders moved slower at tunnel entrances than their average
               crossing speed, suggesting animals may have hesitated at
               entrances. Although cameras documented one case of snake
               predation, images indicated that tunnels were not significant
               predator traps for salamanders. Camera data revealed the same
               patterns of demographics and spatio-temporal variation in tunnel
               use for A. macrodactylum as did trapping; thus, cameras
               represent a novel, cost-efficient, noninvasive approach to
               monitoring amphibian tunnel use. However, we encourage managers
               to either augment motion-detection cameras or rely on images
               recorded at set time intervals to document tunnel use

               ecosystems frequently support invasive species to the detriment
               of native species. Rana catesbeiana (American bullfrog) is an
               invasive amphibian that thrives in modified aquatic habitats. In
               2004--2005 we studied the distribution of bullfrogs along a
               98-km reach of the Trinity River below the Lewiston Dam to
               identify habitat characteristics associated with bullfrogs and
               to recommend actions to reduce their prevalence in the system.
               We also examined native amphibian distributions relative to
               bullfrogs and disturbance regimes. We used regression techniques
               to model the distribution of bullfrogs in relation to
               environmental conditions. Models assessing breeding habitat
               outperformed models assessing bullfrog presence. Top-ranked
               predictor variables of bullfrog distribution included water
               depth, percent rooted floating vegetation, and river km. Most
               breeding sites of bullfrogs were relict mine tailing ponds or
               inactive side channels created during restoration activities in
               the 1990s. Native species were more common in the lower reach
               where habitats were less modified, in contrast to the
               distribution of bullfrogs that dominated the upper, more
               modified reach. To control bullfrogs along a managed river, we
               suggest reducing the suitability of breeding sites by decreasing
               depth or reducing hydroperiod and increasing connection with the
               active river channel. Current management goals of restoring
               salmonid habitat and returning the river to a more natural
               hydrologic condition should aid in control of bullfrogs and

              predictor variables fish presence/absence, amphibian
              presence/absence (only in models for the two reptile species),
              elevation, water depth, littoral zone and shoreline substrate
              composition, relative survey date, and location. All species
              showed significant associations with habitat characteristics, and
              elevation and water depth appeared particularly important in
              influencing distributions. In addition, distributions of the
              mountain yellow-legged frog (Rana muscosa) and Pacific treefrog

              Yosemite's herpetofauna. Long-term studies will be necessary to
              determine whether removal of nonnative trout populations, where

  abstract  = "River floodplains are disturbance-dominated landscapes where
               floods are major regulators of both aquatic and nearby
               terrestrial communities. Amphibians are common inhabitants of
               floodplains and their life cycle depends on both aquatic and
               terrestrial habitats. We focused on how different syntopic
               species of amphibians reacted to the environmental conditions of
               a large river floodplain. We examined life-history traits such
               as population age structure and growth in small- and
               large-bodied species of anurans and urodeles in the lower Danube
               River floodplain in Romania. Two newt species, Triturus vulgaris
               (small-bodied) and Triturus dobrogicus (large-bodied), and two
               anuran taxa, Bombina bombina (small-bodied) and the Rana
               esculenta complex (large-bodied), were included in the study.
               The ages of individuals estimated by skeletochronology varied
               from 3 to 5?6 years for T. vulgaris and from 2?3 to 4?5 years
               for T. dobrogicus. In the anurans, ages varied from 2 to 5 years
               in B. bombina and from 4 to 10 years in the R. esculenta
               complex. The numbers of breeding opportunities (i.e., the number
               of years the adults reproduce) are similar in both newt species
               (3), while growth rates and age at maturity differ between the
               large- and small-bodied species. In anurans, the number of
               breeding opportunities for the smallest species, B. bombina (4),
               is associated with a high growth rate and earlier maturation. In
               the larger R. esculenta complex, the higher number of breeding
               opportunities (7) is associated with a low growth rate and
               delayed maturation. The study of age distribution and associated
               parameters provides useful information on population life
               history. We discuss how age structure and growth of amphibian

               the early 1900s. Our comparisons show that at least five of the
               seven frog and toad species in the area have suffered serious
               declines. One species has disappeared from the area entirely and
               a second species, formerly the most abundant amphibian in the
               area, has dwindled to a few small remnant populations. These
               declines have occurred in a relatively undisturbed, protected
               area and show some of the same patterns noted in other reports
               of amphibian declines. Introduced predatory fish, possibly
               interacting with drought-induced loss of refuge habitats, have
               contributed to the decline of some species. However, the overall
               cause of these dramatic losses remains unknown.",

  author   = "Bradford, David F",
  abstract = "Both larval and metamorphosed Rana muscosa (mountain
              yellow?legged frog) over?winter for 6?9 mo in ice?covered lakes
              and streams at high elevation ($\leq$3700 m) in California and
              Nevada. In some winters almost all the frogs in shallow lakes (<4
              m deep) die. This mortality is associated with oxygen depletion,
              which occurs most rapidly in shallow lakes. However, tadpoles
              survive for months in nearly anoxic conditions when shallow lakes
              are frozen to the bottom. In the laboratory at low P02, oxygen
              metabolism of overwintering tadpoles at 4° differed from that of
              frogs. The critical oxygen tension (Pc) of tadpoles (1.98 kPa)
              was significantly lower than for frogs (4.04 kPa). Also, when P02
              was greater than Pc, the resting oxygen consumption (V02) of
              tadpoles partially conformed to P02, whereas the resting V02 of
              frogs was constant. At the atmosphere P02 of their natural
              environment (P02 °13.3 kPa), however, the resting V02 of tadpoles
              was not significantly different from that of frogs. Tadpoles
              apparently have two advantages over frogs during winter: (1) a
              greater tolerance of low P02, and (2) a reduced consumption of
              energy and oxygen at low P02. Unlike a number of anuran species
              which become dormant on land at temperatures above 4°, the
              resting V02 of metamorphosed R. muscosa overwintering at 4° was
              nearly the same as for summer?acclimated individuals in air at
              4°. During 7 mo dormancy, the standard metabolic rate of both
              tadpoles and frogs remained constant. Resulting V02 of frogs in
              water at 4°, and in air at 15° was related to the 0.83?0.85 power
              of body mass.",

              have recently disappeared from seemingly pristine sites. The

              and metamorphosed R. muscosa in a lake in Kings Canyon National
              Park, California, and the ultimate extinction of the population.
              In 1979 metamorphosed individuals declined from ca. 800
              individuals in early summer to nearly zero in late summer. During
              this time many carcasses were collected, individuals showed
              symptoms of red-leg disease, and blood from an affected
              individual contained the bacterial pathogen characteristic of
              this disease, Aeromonas hydrophila. Also during the summer of
              1979, nearly all of the approximately 1100 tadpoles began
              metamorphosis, but all metamorphosing individuals were consumed
              by Brewer's blackbirds (Euphagus cyanocephalus). This population
              of R. muscosa continued to exist until at least 1983, but was
              extinct by 1989. Recolonization of the site will probably never

              sampling method in genetic studies of wild populations, including
              amphibian species. Yet it is not known to date what is the level
              of reliability for microsatellite genotypes obtained using such
              samples. Allelic dropout and false alleles may affect the
              genotyping derived from buccal samples. Here we quantified the
              success of microsatellite amplification and the rates of
              genotyping errors using buccal swabs in two amphibian species,
              the Alpine newt Triturus alpestris and the Green tree frog Hyla
              arborea, and we estimated two important parameters for downstream
              analyses, namely the number of repetitions required to achieve
              typing reliability and the probability of identity among
              genotypes. Amplification success was high, and only one locus
              tested required two to three repetitions to achieve reliable
              genotypes, showing that buccal swabbing is a very efficient
              approach allowing good quality DNA retrieval. This sampling
              method which allows avoiding the controversial toe-clipping will

              surrounding breeding ponds. A geographical information system
              (GIS) was used to compile a landuse map, from which permeability
              estimates ( friction) were derived. Potential migration zones
              based on friction and maximum migration distance were then
              modeled. Contacts between several migration zones suggest the
              potential for migration between ponds by adult individuals. The
              ability of the migration zones to enhance predictions of species
              occurrence was tested using generalized additive models (GAMs),
              and several landscape variables were selected as determinants of
              amphibian presence. The area of a migration zone and the number
              of ponds within that zone were positively related to both toad
              and newt presence, suggesting the importance of buffer habitats
              around each pond in amphibian conservation. Toad presence
              declined with cultivated field area and newt presence declined
              with vineyard area, suggesting the negative effect of
              agricultural activity on amphibians. The friction-based modeling

              to a more classical analysis of habitat composition within a
              circular zone centered on the focal pond. Prediction of newt
              presence was, however, less accurate than prediction of toad
              presence. Despite its exploratory nature and the subjectivity of
              permeability estimates, this study shows the usefulness of GIS in
              the functional analysis of a landscape, with potential

               to identify the phylogeographic and conservation genetic
               parameters of L. aurea. Mitochondrial DNA sequences were
               examined from 263 individuals sampled from 26 locations using
               both phylogenetic and population analyses. Despite a general
               consensus that amphibians are highly structured we found no
               phylogeographic divisions within the species, however, there was
               significant structure amongst extant populations (FST=0.385).

               amphibians, despite frequent disturbances by floods or droughts.
               Amphibian richness within a given habitat was significantly

              In laboratory conditions, optimal temperatures for Bd growth and
              survivorship are between 17 and 25 degrees C. We investigated the
              effect of different storage temperatures, both in field and
              laboratory conditions, on detection of Bd from swabs stored for 7
              d. We sampled 52 wild Litoria wilcoxii males for Bd by
              simultaneously running 2 cotton swabs along the skin of the frog.
              One group of swabs was stored in a freezer within 2 h of sampling
              and the other was kept in a car in an exposed environment for 7 d
              before being stored in the freezer. In the laboratory experiment,
              swabs were inoculated with zoospores of Bd and underwent one of 4
              treatments: immediate DNA extraction, or storage at 27, 38 or 45
              degrees C for 7 d prior to DNA extraction. Swabs from all
              treatments were analyzed by quantitative (real-time) PCR test.
              Though prevalence of Bd did not differ significantly between
              swabs that were frozen and those that remained in a car for 7 d
              (19.2 vs. 17.3\%, respectively), the number of Bd zoospores
              detected on car swabs taken from infected frogs was, on average,
              67\% less than that detected on the corresponding frozen swab. In
              the laboratory experiment, the number of zoospore equivalents
              varied significantly with treatment (F(3,35) = 4.769, p = 0.007),
              indicating that there was reduced recovery of Bd DNA from swabs
              stored at higher temperatures compared with those stored at lower
              temperatures or processed immediately. We conclude that failure
              to store swabs in cool conditions can result in a significant
              reduction in the amount of Bd DNA detected using the PCR assay.

               this provides a time series to examine the causes of population
               fluctuations. We examined archived museum specimens of 15 anuran
               species collected at wetlands on the SRS for the presence of the
               causative agent (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) of
               chytridiomycosis, an emerging disease associated with population
               declines elsewhere. Infections were present in three out of 137
               (2.18\%) individuals; the pathogen was detected in two Rana
               catesbeiana and a single Rana sphenocephala, all collected
               between 1978 and 1981. Lesions were not consistent with the
               later stages of fatal chytridiomycosis. Analysis of population
               trajectories of nine amphibian species over 26 years at SRS
               showed that four species declined significantly over this
               period, including R. sphenocephala. However, we demonstrate that
               these declines are more likely caused by an increase in the
               number of years with insufficient rainfall and a shortened
               hydroperiod at the breeding site than by chytrid epidemics. This
               pattern appears to be linked to a drying trend at SRS through
               the 1990s, although it is unclear whether this was caused by
               climate change. This study demonstrates that the presence of B.
               dendrobatidis in amphibian communities where some species are
               declining does not always implicate chytrids as a cause of the
               decline. Like many other emerging pathogens, the outcome of
               infection can vary among individuals and populations, depending
               on life history traits, environmental conditions, and virulence
               factors of the pathogen. Our report also demonstrates the
               usefulness of archived museum specimens and long-term population

  abstract  = "* 1Phenotypic plasticity may allow an organism to respond to
               temporally variable opportunities for growth and risks of
               mortality. However, life-history theory assumes that there are
               often trade-offs between the benefits afforded by plasticity in
               one trait and the consequences of that plasticity on other
               traits that affect fitness. In organisms with a complex life
               cycle, trade-offs may occur between larval and post-metamorphic
               traits. * 2Many amphibians metamorphose in temporary ponds, and
               may accelerate larval development to avoid mortality when a pond
               desiccates. A younger age at metamorphosis often results in
               reduced body size, but may also facilitate a trade-off with
               physiological traits that are linked to fitness in the adult
               stage. * 3We investigated a potential trade-off between
               desiccation-driven acceleration of development rate and immune
               system responsiveness in a species that breeds exclusively in
               temporary ponds. We exposed Rana sylvatica (wood frog) tadpoles
               to four possible desiccation regimes and then assayed the
               cell-mediated immune response to a standardized foreign antigen,
               phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), injected 3 weeks after metamorphosis.
               We also quantified total leucocyte numbers from haematological
               smears to obtain a secondary measure of individual immunological
               condition. * 4Animals exposed to desiccation had shorter
               development times, weaker cellular immune system responses to
               PHA and lower total leucocyte numbers than animals from control
               groups. Both measures of immune response showed a decrease with
               increasing severity of the desiccation treatment. * 5It is
               currently unclear whether the observed depression in immune
               response is transient or permanent. However, even temporary
               periods of immune system suppression shortly after metamorphosis
               may lead to greater susceptibility to opportunistic pathogens or

              conservation implications, especially with regard to establishing
              road closures aimed at minimizing road mortality. We examined the
              timing of juvenile emigration and adult immigration in four
              species of pond-breeding amphibians (Ambystoma maculatum,
              Ambystoma opacum, Notophthalmus viridescens, and Rana sylvatica)

              Regression trees were variously successful in producing an
              effective and parsimonious description and robust prediction of
              large movement events based on a suite of temporal and
              meteorological variables. Julian date, degree-days, temperature,
              precipitation and droughtiness were all important correlates of
              movement for one or more species and age class. The amount of
              rainfall during the previous 24h period was an important variable
              in four of the five trees built, and degree-days was an important
              variable in two of the three trees built describing juvenile
              emigration. In four of six cases, regression trees identified a
              few days each year that accounted for a large percentage of the
              total annual movement, and thus offered a practical means to
              determine when road-closure events designed to minimize road

              increased mortality compared with those that hibernated suggested
              one possible mechanism. I used data from a field study of common
              toads (Bufo bufo) in the UK, between 1983 and 2005, to determine
              whether this also occurs in the field. The results demonstrated
              two pathways by which global warming may cause amphibian
              declines. First, there was a clear relationship between a decline
              in the body condition of female common toads and the occurrence
              of warmer than average years since 1983. This was paralleled by a
              decline in their annual survival rates with the relationship
              between these two declines being highly correlated. Second, there
              was a significant relationship between the occurrence of mild
              winters and a reduction in female body size, resulting in fewer
              eggs being laid annually. Climate warming can, therefore, act on
              wild temperate zone amphibians by deleteriously affecting their
              physiology, during and after hibernation, causing increased
              female mortality rates and decreased fecundity in survivors.",

              disease-related extirpations are recent phenomena, and effects of
              both are especially noticeable at high elevations in tropical
              areas, making it difficult to determine whether they are
              operating separately or synergistically. We compiled reports of
              amphibian declines from Lower Central America and Andean South
              America to create maps and statistical models to test our
              hypothesis of spatiotemporal spread of the pathogen
              Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and to update the
              elevational patterns of decline in frogs belonging to the genus

              Available data support the hypothesis of multiple introductions

              they are vulnerable to human induced landscape change. We
              investigated for 199 ponds in the `d{\'e}partement' Pas-de-Calais
              in north-western France if pond persistence (n=86, 43\%) or
              disappearance (n=113, 57\%) was related to wider changes in the
              landscape, over the period 1975--2006. Landscape data were
              obtained from aerial photographs (1963), two ASTER satellite
              images (2001 and 2003) and observations on the ground (1975 and
              2006) and land use around the ponds was described over concentric
              circles with five different radii in the 100--1000m range.
              Overall, pond disappearance was associated with a decrease in
              grassland and an increase in arable fields around the ponds. We
              found that the small, man-made cattle ponds, with either natural
              substrate or concrete drinking troughs, were more often affected
              than the larger, semi-natural ponds. Since the cattle ponds are
              regularly used for amphibian reproduction, their massive
              abandonment therewith weakens the population network and puts the
              local occurrence of some of the rarer species at risk. Spatial
              extrapolation of models on pond persistence allowed the
              identification of areas most at risk of further pond loss. We

  abstract  = "Aim We explore the relationship between current European
               distributions of amphibian and reptile species and observed
               climate, and project species potential distributions into the
               future. Potential impacts of climate warming are assessed by
               quantifying the magnitude and direction of modelled
               distributional shifts for every species. In particular we ask,
               first, what proportion of amphibian and reptile species are
               projected to lose and gain suitable climate space in the future?
               Secondly, do species projections vary according to taxonomic,
               spatial or environmental properties? And thirdly, what climate
               factors might be driving projections of loss or gain in suitable
               environments for species? Location Europe. Methods Distributions
               of species are modelled with four species--climate envelope
               techniques (artificial neural networks, generalized linear
               models, generalized additive models, and classification tree
               analyses) and distributions are projected into the future using
               five climate-change scenarios for 2050. Future projections are
               made considering two extreme assumptions: species have unlimited
               dispersal ability and species have no dispersal ability. A novel
               hybrid approach for combining ensembles of forecasts is then
               used to group linearly covarying projections into clusters with
               reduced inter-model variability. Results We show that a great
               proportion of amphibian and reptile species are projected to
               expand distributions if dispersal is unlimited. This is because
               warming in the cooler northern ranges of species creates new
               opportunities for colonization. If species are unable to
               disperse, then most species are projected to lose range. Loss of
               suitable climate space for species is projected to occur mainly
               in the south-west of Europe, including the Iberian Peninsula,
               whilst species in the south-east are projected to gain suitable
               climate. This is because dry conditions in the south-west are
               projected to increase, approaching the levels found in North
               Africa, where few amphibian species are able to persist. Main
               conclusions The impact of increasing temperatures on amphibian
               and reptile species may be less deleterious than previously
               postulated; indeed, climate cooling would be more deleterious
               for the persistence of amphibian and reptile species than
               warming. The ability of species to cope with climate warming
               may, however, be offset by projected decreases in the
               availability of water. This should be particularly true for
               amphibians. Limited dispersal ability may further increase the
               vulnerability of amphibians and reptiles to changes in climate.",

  abstract = "Abstract Effective conservation of amphibian populations requires
              the prediction of how amphibians use and move through a
              landscape. Amphibians are closely coupled to their physical
              environment. Thus an approach that uses the physiological
              attributes of amphibians, together with knowledge of their
              natural history, should be helpful. We used Niche Mapper™ to
              model the known movements and habitat use patterns of a
              population of Western toads (Anaxyrus (=Bufo) boreas) occupying
              forested habitats in southeastern Idaho. Niche Mapper uses first
              principles of environmental biophysics to combine features of
              topography, climate, land cover, and animal features to model
              microclimates and animal physiology and behavior across
              landscapes. Niche Mapper reproduced core body temperatures (Tc)
              and evaporation rates of live toads with average errors of
              1.6$\pm$0.4°C and 0.8$\pm$0.2g/h, respectively. For four
              different habitat types, it reproduced similar mid-summer daily
              temperature patterns as those measured in the field and
              calculated evaporation rates (g/h) with an average error rate of
              7.2$\pm$5.5\%. Sensitivity analyses indicate these errors do not
              significantly affect estimates of food consumption or activity.
              Using Niche Mapper we predicted the daily habitats used by
              free-ranging toads; our accuracy for female toads was greater
              than for male toads (74.2$\pm$6.8\% and 53.6$\pm$15.8\%,
              respectively), reflecting the stronger patterns of habitat
              selection among females. Using these changing to construct a cost
              surface, we also reconstructed movement paths that were
              consistent with field observations. The effect of climate warming
              on toads depends on the interaction of temperature and
              atmospheric moisture. If climate change occurs as predicted,
              results from Niche Mapper suggests that climate warming will
              increase the physiological cost of landscapes thereby limiting
              the activity for toads in different habitats.",

  abstract = "Abstract Amphibians have declined dramatically in many areas of
              the world. These declines seem to have worsened over the past 25
              years and amphibians are now more threatened than either mammals
              or birds, though comparisons with other taxa are confounded by a
              shortage of reliable data. Research into amphibian declines has
              focused on: (1) documentation at the landscape or population
              level; and (2) observational and experimental work on potential
              causes of declines. Although loss of habitat is known to have
              impacted amphibians for decades, recent research has focused on
              the effects of environmental contaminants, UV-B irradiation,
              emerging diseases, the introduction of alien species, direct
              exploitation, and climate change. Such factors may interact with
              each other, but high levels of mortality do not necessarily lead
              to population declines. Major challenges remain in extrapolating
              from experimental data to population level effects, and in
              developing methodologies that will provide unbiased descriptions
              of amphibian population dynamics. Although amphibians have been
              widely advocated as good biological indicators, there is little
              evidence to suggest that they are more effective than other taxa

  abstract = "Abstract Amphibian declines and extinctions are a worldwide
              concern. Conservation priorities for amphibians should target
              threatened taxa (taxonomic targets) and regions with high levels
              of species endemism (geographical targets). Does published
              research on amphibian conservation reflect the global taxonomic
              and geographic priorities? I surveyed six years (2000--2005) of
              10 conservation and herpetological journals (Amphibia--Reptilia,
              Animal Conservation, Applied Herpetology, Biodiversity and
              Conservation, Biological Conservation, Conservation Biology,
              Copeia, Herpetologica, Journal of Herpetology and Oryx), and
              analyzed all articles on amphibians. Attention indexes were
              calculated for orders, threatened species and biogeographic
              realms. I also examined how well research from tropical
              developing nations (with high levels of richness and endemism)
              are represented in the international literature. Attention
              indexes results show that the most studied amphibian order is
              Caudata, whereas Gymnophiona is the least studied one. The same
              trend is observed for threatened species, with threatened Caudata
              species receiving proportionally more attention than threatened
              Anura and Gymnophiona. The biogeographic realms that receive most
              attention by amphibian conservationists are: Oceania, Nearctic
              and Palearctic. However, the Neotropical, Afrotropical and
              Indomalayan are the regions with higher species diversity.
              Forty-one countries contributed articles, but the majority of
              amphibian conservation research is conducted by North American
              and western European researchers. There is urgent need for
              capacity building in tropical developing nations. Amphibians are
              more threatened and are declining more rapidly than either birds
              or mammals. However, amphibian conservation is still misplacing
              its focus in lower-biodiversity regions and non-threatened
              species. If such trends are not changed, the consequences for the
              persistence of amphibians worldwide may be dire.",

              for a dispersing forest amphibian",
  author   = "Cline, Brittany B and Hunter, Malcolm L",
  abstract = "* Population viability often depends on conserving functional
              connectivity in fragmented landscapes. For pool-breeding
              amphibians, population connectivity is largely maintained through
              juvenile dispersal, often through various vegetation types that
              may differ as filters or conduits to movement. * We quantified
              the relative permeability of different types of open-canopy
              vegetation to juvenile wood frogs Lithobates sylvaticus to
              determine whether this influences functional connectivity during
              dispersal. * We conducted experimental releases of juveniles (n =
              561) in ten runways representing five treatments: hayfield,
              moderate-cover lawn (45--85\% cover), open lawn (0\% cover), row
              crop (forage-corn) and recent clear-cut. Runways consisted of 35
              $\times$ 2·5 m enclosures, located perpendicular to a forest edge
              and extending into treatment areas with tracking stations at 10,
              20 and 30 m. As indices of permeability, we measured the number
              of animals traversing each station, the proportion changing
              direction, movement timing and movement rates. * Based on an
              index that compounds four metrics and scales them relative to
              mature forest as a control, permeability varied between
              open-canopy cover types in the following order: row crop <
              hayfield < clear-cut < open lawn < moderate-cover lawn. * The
              highest proportions of individuals changed direction (towards
              forest) in the hayfield, moderate-cover lawn and clear-cut,
              suggesting that juveniles may make forays into the open and
              subsequently assess habitat. Nonetheless, individuals could
              eventually transit entire runways, indicated by overall
              recaptures at 30 m (e.g. hayfield, 29\%; moderate-cover lawn,
              24\%; and clear-cut, 20\%) at the end of our six-week experiment.
              * Synthesis and applications. We provide quantitative evidence
              that open-canopy cover types may act as differential ecological
              filters to ranging movements, and ultimately dispersal.
              Differences in the willingness of animals to enter treatments,
              coupled with motility and residency times, support the differing
              roles of open-canopy vegetation as both filters and conduits to
              movement. Thus, it may be overly simplistic to estimate matrix
              permeability as uniformly low in models that predict movement in
              fragmented landscapes. To promote functional connectivity,
              modification of vegetation composition and configuration may
              provide an underutilized tool for conservation practitioners to
              reduce the effective isolation of habitat patches for

               some populations are inevitably missed. Estimates of abundance
               and distribution are biased when detection probabilities are not
               taken into account. * 2.Data were analysed from a large-scale
               volunteer-based amphibian monitoring programme using recently
               developed methods for estimating site occupancy. The analysis
               revealed that detection probabilities were much smaller than

               unpredictable way despite the fact that standardized field

              chytridiomycosis, a cutaneous disease caused by the chytrid
              fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis, but increasing evidence
              suggests that this pathogen may coexist with some species without
              causing declines. In the Venezuelan Andes, the disappearance of
              three anuran species during the late eighties was attributed to
              B. dendrobatidis. Recently, this pathogen was found to be
              prevalent in this region on the introduced American bullfrog,
              Lithobates catesbeianus. As a first step toward assessing the
              risk of amphibian communities to B. dendrobatidis in this region,
              we conducted a broad survey across multiple habitat types and an
              altitudinal gradient spanning over 2000m. We diagnosed 649 frogs
              from 17 species using real time and conventional PCR assays, and
              recorded relevant abiotic characteristics of host habitats.
              Infection was detected in 10 native species of pond, stream and
              terrestrial habitats from 80--2600m, representing nine new host
              records. L. catesbeianus was the most important reservoir with
              79.9\% of individuals infected and an average of 2299 zoospores.
              Among native frogs, Dendropsophus meridensis, an endangered
              species sympatric with L. catesbeianus, showed the highest
              infection prevalence and mean zoospore load (26.7\%; 2749
              zoospores). We did not detect clinical signs of disease in
              infected hosts; however, species such as D. meridensis may be at
              risk if environmental stress exacerbates vulnerability or
              pathogen loads. While surveillance is an effective strategy to
              identify highly exposed species and habitats, we need to
              understand species-specific responses to B. dendrobatidis to
              stratify risk in amphibian communities.",

               disease surveys of frogs representing five ecological guilds in

               stream-breeding amphibian populations, infection prevalence and
               intensity would be greatest in frogs breeding in permanent,
               flowing water. Overall, 30.3\% of the 519 frogs we sampled were
               infected with B. dendrobatidis. However, infections were not
               evenly distributed across the ecological guilds, being almost
               completely restricted to frogs breeding at permanent
               waterbodies. Of these, stream breeders were significantly more

               disappearances of stream-breeding amphibian populations in
               recent decades, and will enable wildlife managers to more

               environments has been linked with local extinctions and altered
               distributions of native species. We investigated the effect of
               non-native salmonids on the occupancy of two native amphibians,
               the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and Columbia
               spotted frog (Rana luteiventris), across three spatial scales:
               water bodies, small catchments and large catchments. Location
               Mountain lakes at $\geq$ 1500 m elevation were surveyed across
               the northern Rocky Mountains, USA. Methods We surveyed 2267
               water bodies for amphibian occupancy (based on evidence of
               reproduction) and fish presence between 1986 and 2002 and
               modelled the probability of amphibian occupancy at each spatial
               scale in relation to habitat availability and quality and fish
               presence. Results After accounting for habitat features, we
               estimated that A. macrodactylum was 2.3 times more likely to
               breed in fishless water bodies than in water bodies with fish.
               Ambystoma macrodactylum also was more likely to occupy small
               catchments where none of the water bodies contained fish than in
               catchments where at least one water body contained fish.
               However, the probability of salamander occupancy in small
               catchments was also influenced by habitat availability (i.e. the
               number of water bodies within a catchment) and suitability of
               remaining fishless water bodies. We found no relationship
               between fish presence and salamander occupancy at the
               large-catchment scale, probably because of increased habitat
               availability. In contrast to A. macrodactylum, we found no
               relationship between fish presence and R. luteiventris occupancy
               at any scale. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the
               negative effects of non-native salmonids can extend beyond the
               boundaries of individual water bodies and increase A.
               macrodactylum extinction risk at landscape scales. We suspect
               that niche overlap between non-native fish and A. macrodactylum
               at higher elevations in the northern Rocky Mountains may lead to
               extinction in catchments with limited suitable habitat.",

  title     = "Amphibian declines: future directions",
  author    = "Storfer, Andrew",
  abstract  = "Abstract. The amphibian decline problem is complex, and there is
               no easy solution. I highlight four major areas of future
               research that should increase our ability to detect declines,
               elucidate their underlying mechanisms, and advance our capacity
               to manage and conserve amphibian populations. First, a
               statistically sensitive monitoring approach is necessary to
               determine the distribution and abundance of amphibian
               populations, to assess whether they are declining, and to
               quantify the extent of declines. Most amphibian populations
               characteristically fluctuate, detection probabilities may be low
               for many species and populations tend to decline in numbers
               between years more often than they increase. These traits make
               establishing monitoring programmes difficult and distinguishing
               declines from natural fluctuations challenging. It is thus
               necessary to determine the best monitoring techniques based on
               their statistical power and to use appropriate statistical
               methods for detecting population trends. Secondly, although
               amphibian population studies occur most commonly at single or
               few breeding sites, research should occur often at the landscape
               level, and conservation efforts should focus on suitable habitat
               (whether or not it is occupied) and dispersal capabilities of
               species. Metapopulation dynamics are probably important for many
               species, but we must be cautious how we define metapopulations.
               That is, the term `metapopulation' is currently used to define a
               wide range of demographic situations in amphibian populations,
               each with different management implications. Thirdly, recent
               advances in molecular genetic techniques make it possible to
               infer demographic events such as effects of recent
               fragmentation, bottlenecks or hybridization. Molecular
               techniques can be used in conjunction with census surveys to
               bolster knowledge about demographic processes such as declines.
               Alternatively, in the absence of long-term census data,
               molecular data can be used to infer population trends. New
               genomic approaches may make estimating adaptive genetic
               variation more feasible. Fourthly, multi-factorial studies are
               needed to disentangle the complexity of the several putative
               causes that probably interact to cause amphibian declines.
               Recent studies demonstrate the value of a multi-factorial
               approach, and more work is needed to elucidate the synergistic
               effects of multiple environmental factors affecting amphibian
               populations simultaneously worldwide.",

               research of amphibian road mortality is scarce, fragmented,
               fraught with methodological problems, and largely inconclusive.
               As the first attempt at a synthesis, we analyzed all available
               data on amphibian mortality in Europe and combined them with
               four previously unpublished surveys conducted by us. Based on
               our recalculation of road-kill counts in terms of
               species-specific road-kill recordability, we conclude that, in
               lowland Central Europe, the common toads, Bufo bufo, are the
               most common victims of vehicular traffic in suburban landscapes,
               while the common frogs, Rana temporaria and Triturus newts,
               prevail in rural landscapes. The green frogs also tend to be
               more frequent in rural areas. Common tree frogs, Hyla arborea,
               are unexpectedly rare in the road-kill record despite their
               terrestrial and migratory habits. In consideration of problems
               with obtaining accurate amphibian population estimates, we
               further propose the road kills-to-spawners ratio (R/S) as a
               working measure of the impact of road mortality on a local
               population. While the R/S ratio may not reflect the losses to an
               entire local amphibian population, it is free of the errors of
               whole-population estimates, which are notoriously difficult for
               amphibians. When corrected for species-specific road-kill
               recordability, most results suggest that the impact of roads on
               newts may have been underestimated and that the impact on common
               frog populations may be higher than on those of common toads.",

              probabilities, environmental variables, and management effects
              were examined in 141 randomly selected perennial streams in
              commercial forests west of the Cascade Crest in Oregon and
              Washington from July to October, 2006. Giant salamander occupancy
              varied by stream substrate type (i.e., consolidated vs.
              unconsolidated geologies) and was positively associated with
              stand age. Torrent salamander occupancy varied by species, was
              positively associated with channel gradient, and was reduced in
              the youngest and oldest sampled stands. Tailed frog occupancy was
              negatively associated with the presence of crayfish, negatively
              associated with low and high bankfull widths, and positively
              associated with stand age, although stands less than 5 years old

              detection rates were less than 1 for all three genera (0.85,
              0.66, and 0.63 for Dicamptodon, Rhyacotriton, and Ascaphus,

              research about relationships between SAA occupancy, environmental
              variables, and forest practices have an unknown element of
              uncertainty, particularly if detection rates co-vary with habitat

              states in the United States and in a number of European
              countries, yet the scale of impacts of road salt on aquatic
              organisms remains largely under-studied. The issue is germane to
              amphibian conservation because both adult and larval amphibians
              are known to be particularly sensitive to changes in their
              osmolar environments. In this study, we combined survey,
              experimental, and demographic modeling approaches to evaluate the
              possible effects of road salt on two common vernal-pond-breeding
              amphibian species, the spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum)
              and the wood frog (Rana sylvatica). We found that in the
              Adirondack Mountain Region of New York (USA), road salt traveled
              up to 172 m from the highway into wetlands. Surveys showed that
              egg mass densities of spotted salamanders (A. maculatum) and wood
              frogs (R. sylvatica) were two times higher in forest pools than
              roadside pools, but this pattern was better explained by road
              proximity than by increased salinity. Experiments demonstrated
              that embryonic and larval survival were reduced at moderate (500
              muS) and high conductivities (3000 muS) in A. maculatum and at
              high conductivities in R. sylvatica. Demographic models suggest
              that such egg and larval stage effects of salt may have important
              impacts on populations near roads, particularly in the case of A.
              maculatum, for which salt exposure may lead to local extinction.
              For both species, the effect of road salt was dependent upon the
              strength of larval density dependence and declined rapidly with
              distance from the roadside, with the greatest negative effects
              being limited to within 50 m. Based on this evidence, we argue
              that efforts to protect local populations of A. maculatum and R.
              sylvatica in roadside wetlands should, in part, be aimed at
              reducing application of road salt near wetlands with high

  author   = "Relyea, Rick A and Diecks, Nicole",
  abstract = "The field of toxicology has traditionally assessed the risk of
              contaminants by using laboratory experiments and a range of
              pesticide concentrations that are held constant for short periods
              of time (1-4 days). From these experiments, one can estimate the
              concentration that causes no effect on survival. However,
              organisms in nature frequently experience multiple, applications
              of pesticides over time rather than a single constant
              concentration. In addition, organisms are embedded in ecological
              communities that can propagate indirect effects through a food
              web. Using outdoor mesocosms, we examined how low concentrations
              (10-250 microg/L) of a globally common insecticide (malathion)
              applied at various amounts, times, and frequencies affected
              aquatic communities containing zooplankton, phytoplankton,
              periphyton, and larval amphibians (reared at two densities) for
              79 days. All application regimes caused a decline in zooplankton,
              which initiated a trophic cascade in which there was a bloom in
              phytoplankton and, in several treatments, a subsequent decline in
              the competing periphyton. The reduced periphyton had little
              effect on wood frogs (Rana sylvatica), which have a short time to
              metamorphosis. However, leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) have a
              longer time to metamorphosis, and they experienced large
              reductions in growth and development, which led to subsequent
              mortality as the environment dried. Hence, malathion (which
              rapidly breaks down) did not directly kill amphibians, but
              initiated a trophic cascade that indirectly resulted in
              substantial amphibian mortality. Importantly, repeated
              applications of the lowest concentration (a ``press treatment''
              consisting of seven weekly applications of 10 microg/L) caused
              larger impacts on many of the response variables than single
              ``pulse'' applications that were 25 times as great in
              concentration. These results are not only important because
              malathion is the most commonly applied insecticide and is found
              in wetlands, but also because the mechanism underlying the
              trophic cascade is common to a wide range of insecticides,
              offering the possibility of general predictions for the way in
              which many insecticides impact aquatic communities and the
              populations of larval amphibians.",

              where amphibians breed. The present study examined the chronic
              toxicity of two of the insecticides most commonly used in the
              Central Valley and found in the mountains, chlorpyrifos and
              endosulfan, to larval Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla) and

              implications of this toxicity to declining amphibian populations.
              Larvae were exposed to the pesticides from Gosner stages 25 to 26
              through metamorphosis. The estimated median lethal concentration
              (LC50) for chlorpyrifos was 365 microg/L in P. regilla and 66.5
              microg/L for R. boylii. Time to metamorphosis increased with
              concentration of chlorpyrifos in both species, and cholinesterase
              activity declined with exposure concentration in metamorphs of
              both species at Gosner stages 42 to 46. For endosulfan, the
              estimated LC50 was 15.6 microg/L for P. regilla and 0.55 microg/L
              for R. boylii. All R. boylii exposed to concentrations of greater
              than 0.8 microg/L died before they entered metamorphosis.
              Pseudacris regilla remains relatively abundant and is broadly
              distributed throughout California. In contrast, R. boylii is
              among the species experiencing severe population declines. The

               streams of the Pacific Northwest. Freshwater Biology, 53,
               1470--1488] proposing the use of headwater stream amphibians as
               metrics of stream status in the Pacific Northwest (PNW). They
               argued that our analysis of previously published data reflected
               circular reasoning because we reached the same conclusions as
               the earlier studies. In fact, we conducted a meta-analysis to
               address new questions about the optimum values and thresholds
               (based on animal densities) for abiotic stream attributes that
               were found to be important to these amphibians in earlier
               studies. This is analogous to determining blood pressure
               thresholds or fat-to-weight ratios that facilitate predicting
               human health based on meta-analyses of earlier data from studies
               that found significant correlations between these variables and
               relative health. 2. Kroll et al. argued that we should not make
               inference to environmental conditions across the PNW from data
               collected in California. We collected data from northern
               California and southern Oregon, the southern extent of the PNW.
               We made inference to the Klamath-Siskiyou and North Coast
               bioregions, and argued that available research on these
               headwater species indicates that our results have the potential
               to be applied throughout the PNW with minimal regional
               adjustments. 3. Kroll et al. contended that we need reproductive
               success, survival estimates and density estimates, corrected for
               detection probabilities, to establish relationships between
               animal density and stream attributes. Reproductive success and
               survival estimates are important for demographic modelling and
               life tables, but they are not necessary to demonstrate
               meaningful relationships with abiotic conditions. Both corrected
               occupancy estimates and individual detection probabilities are
               unnecessary, and take multiple sampling efforts per site, or
               onerous mark release and re-capture studies, respectively, to
               determine accurately. 4. Kroll et al. questioned the use of
               stream amphibians as a surrogate for measuring physical
               parameters, such as water temperature, claiming that measuring
               the physical parameters directly is more efficient. Here they
               misinterpreted the main point of our paper: stream organisms are
               integrators of what happens in a catchment, and carefully
               selected species can serve as surrogates for the biotic
               community and the relative condition of the network environment.
               5. Kroll et al. claimed that we demonstrated weak inferences
               regarding ecosystem processes. We argue that by relating
               densities of stream amphibians with changes along abiotic
               environmental gradients that are commonly affected by
               anthropogenic activities, we are establishing biological links
               to gradients that represent important ecosystem processes and

              Earth into its sixth mass extinction event and amphibians, the
              most threatened of all vertebrate taxa, are at the forefront.
              Many of the worldwide amphibian declines have been caused by the
              chytrid fungus, Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), and two
              contrasting hypotheses have been proposed to explain these
              declines. Positive correlations between global warming and
              Bd-related declines sparked the chytrid-thermal-optimum
              hypothesis, which proposes that global warming increased cloud
              cover in warm years that drove the convergence of daytime and
              nighttime temperatures toward the thermal optimum for Bd growth.
              In contrast, the spatiotemporal-spread hypothesis states that
              Bd-related declines are caused by the introduction and spread of
              Bd, independent of climate change. We provide a rigorous test of
              these hypotheses by evaluating (i) whether cloud cover,
              temperature convergence, and predicted temperature-dependent Bd
              growth are significant positive predictors of amphibian
              extinctions in the genus Atelopus and (ii) whether spatial
              structure in the timing of these extinctions can be detected
              without making assumptions about the location, timing, or number
              of Bd emergences. We show that there is spatial structure to the
              timing of Atelopus spp. extinctions but that the cause of this
              structure remains equivocal, emphasizing the need for further
              molecular characterization of Bd. We also show that the reported
              positive multi-decade correlation between Atelopus spp.
              extinctions and mean tropical air temperature in the previous
              year is indeed robust, but the evidence that it is causal is weak
              because numerous other variables, including regional banana and
              beer production, were better predictors of these extinctions.
              Finally, almost all of our findings were opposite to the
              predictions of the chytrid-thermal-optimum hypothesis. Although
              climate change is likely to play an important role in worldwide
              amphibian declines, more convincing evidence is needed of a
              causal link.",

              quality and isolation on each species distribution and community

              relate amphibian presence during the breeding season in 84
              wetlands to wetland features and isolation. Jackknife procedure
              was used to evaluate predictive capability of the models. Again,
              we tested the response of each species to habitat features

              strongly on habitat quality and isolation: the richest
              communities live in fish-free, sunny wetlands near to occupied
              wetlands. The negative effects of isolation do not seem to be
              biased by spatial autocorrelation of habitat features. The system
              shows strong nestedness: amphibian persistence depends on the
              contemporary effects of species adaptability and mobility. The
              commonest species, the pool frog (Rana synklepton esculenta) and
              the Italian tree frog (Hyla intermedia), are able to move through

               classical metapopulation models, in which subpopulations in
               breeding ponds blink in and out of existence and extinction and
               colonization rates are functions of pond spatial arrangement.
               This ``ponds-as-patches'' view of amphibian spatial dynamics is
               useful in several respects. First, it highlights the importance
               of regional and landscape processes in determining local
               patterns of abundance. Second, it offers a straightforward,
               pond-based approach to monitoring and managing amphibian
               populations. For many species, however, the ponds-as-patches
               view may be an oversimplification and metapopulation structure
               may be more apparent than real. Changes in distribution may be
               caused by processes other than extinction and recolonization,
               and most extinctions probably result from deterministic factors,
               not stochastic processes. In addition, the effects of pond
               isolation appear to be important primarily in disturbed
               environments, and in many cases these isolation effects may be
               better explained by the distribution of terrestrial habitats
               than by the distribution of breeding ponds. These complications
               have important implications for both researchers and managers.
               For researchers, future efforts need to determine the mechanisms
               underlying patterns of abundance and distributional change and
               patterns in amphibian populations. For managers, effective
               conservation strategies must successfully balance metapopulation
               considerations with careful attention to local habitat quality.
               Furthermore, translocations and active management may be
               indispensable tools for conserving amphibians in landscapes

               apparent that terrestrial areas surrounding wetlands are core
               habitats for many semiaquatic species that depend on mesic
               ecotones to complete their life cycle. For purposes of
               conservation and management, it is important to define core
               habitats used by local breeding populations surrounding
               wetlands. Our objective was to provide an estimate of the
               biologically relevant size of core habitats surrounding wetlands
               for amphibians and reptiles. We summarize data from the
               literature on the use of terrestrial habitats by amphibians and
               reptiles associated with wetlands ( 19 frog and 13 salamander
               species representing 1363 individuals; 5 snake and 28 turtle
               species representing more than 2245 individuals ). Core
               terrestrial habitat ranged from 159 to 290 m for amphibians and
               from 127 to 289 m for reptiles from the edge of the aquatic
               site. Data from these studies also indicated the importance of
               terrestrial habitats for feeding, overwintering, and nesting,

               depending on the level of protection needed, can be used to set
               biologically meaningful buffers for wetland and riparian
               habitats. These results indicate that large areas of terrestrial

              global warming. Seventeen years ago, in the mountains of Costa
              Rica, the Monteverde harlequin frog (Atelopus sp.) vanished along
              with the golden toad (Bufo periglenes). An estimated 67\% of the

              aquatic environments such as ponds and streams is a powerful new
              technique with many benefits. However, species detection in
              eDNA-based surveys is likely to be imperfect, which can lead to
              underestimation of the distribution of a species. * Site
              occupancy models account for imperfect detection and can be used
              to estimate the proportion of sites where a species occurs from
              presence/absence survey data, making them ideal for the analysis
              of eDNA-based surveys. Imperfect detection can result from
              failure to detect the species during field work (e.g. by water
              samples) or during laboratory analysis (e.g. by PCR). * To
              demonstrate the utility of site occupancy models for eDNA
              surveys, we reanalysed a data set estimating the occurrence of
              the amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis using
              eDNA. Our reanalysis showed that the previous estimation of
              species occurrence was low by 5--10\%. Detection probability was
              best explained by an index of the number of hosts (frogs) in
              ponds. * Per-visit availability probability in water samples was
              estimated at 0·45 (95\% CRI 0·32, 0·58) and per-PCR detection
              probability at 0·85 (95\% CRI 0·74, 0·94), and six water samples
              from a pond were necessary for a cumulative detection probability
              >95\%. A simulation study showed that when using site occupancy
              analysis, researchers need many fewer samples to reliably
              estimate presence and absence of species than without use of site
              occupancy modelling. * Our analyses demonstrate the benefits of
              site occupancy models as a simple and powerful tool to estimate
              detection and site occupancy (species prevalence) probabilities
              despite imperfect detection. As species detection from eDNA
              becomes more common, adoption of appropriate statistical methods,
              such as site occupancy models, will become crucial to ensure that

              orthopterans, amphibians, reptiles, and small terrestrial birds)
              and overall species richness in a Mediterranean forest landscape.
              The tested methods included expert knowledge, decision tree
              analysis, principal component analysis, and principal component
              regression. They were compared with random choice and optimal
              sets, which were evaluated by testing all possible combinations
              of metrics. All pre-selection methods performed significantly
              worse than the optimal sets. The statistical approaches performed
              slightly better than random choice that in turn performed
              slightly better than sets derived by expert knowledge. We
              concluded that the process of selecting the most appropriate
              landscape metrics for modelling biodiversity is not trivial and
              that shortcuts to systematic evaluation of metrics should not be
              expected to identify appropriate indicators.",

  title    = "Short-term effect of forest liming on eastern red-backed
              salamander (Plethodon cinereus)",
  author   = "Moore, Jean-David",
  abstract = "Abstract Liming, the application of calcitic materials to soil,
              is increasingly used in acidic, base-poor sugar maple stands of
              eastern North America to restore nutritional status and vigor of
              sugar maple trees. However, few studies have evaluated the effect
              of base cation addition on other components of these ecosystems.
              The eastern red-backed salamander (Plethodon cinereus) is one of
              the most abundant vertebrates in forests of eastern North
              America, and is commonly used as an indicator of forest
              disturbances. So, it is important to know how it might be
              affected by soil liming. This is the first study dealing with the
              potential direct and short-term effect of liming on amphibians of
              North America. Lime, in the form of CaCO3 (3Mgha−1), was added at
              the surface of microcosms containing a low buffered soil and
              forest floor from a sugar maple stand to evaluate the short-term
              effect of this treatment on this amphibian species. Two grades of
              lime were used in this study: finely ground and sandy CaCO3.
              Finely powdered lime was included to verify if it could clog
              salamander skin pores, since this could negatively affect health
              and growth, and consequently induce mortality. The results
              suggest that, even when applied in finely ground form, direct
              contact with lime had no short-term effect on the species' health
              and survival rate. Given this, and the fact that it can be found
              in a wide range of soil pH conditions, the red-backed salamander
              is thus unlikely to be affected by the use of liming to restore
              acidic, base-poor sugar maple bushes. Some old liming trials
              carried out in forests of eastern North America could be used in
              the next years to verify the long-term effects of liming on this
              species. This should help foresters decide whether or not liming
              treatments are compatible with conservation, ecological and
              management objectives.",

  abstract = "Extensive corn production in the midwestern United States has
              physically eliminated or fragmented vast areas of historical
              amphibian habitat. Midwestern corn farmers also apply large
              quantities of fertilizers and herbicides, which can cause direct
              and indirect effects on amphibians. Limited field research
              regarding the statuses of midwestern amphibian populations near
              areas of corn production has left resource managers, conservation
              planners, and other stakeholders needing more information to
              improve conservation strategies and management plans. We
              repeatedly sampled amphibians in wetlands in four conservation
              areas along a gradient of proximity to corn production in
              Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin from 2002 to 2005 and
              estimated site occupancy. We measured frequencies of gross
              physical deformities in recent metamorphs and triazine
              concentrations in the water at breeding sites. We also measured
              trematode infection rates in kidneys of recently metamorphosed
              Lithobates pipiens collected from nine wetlands in 2003 and 2004.
              We detected all possible amphibian species in each study area.
              The amount of nearby row crops was limited in importance as a
              covariate for estimating site occupancy. We observed deformities
              in <5\% of metamorphs sampled and proportions were not associated
              with triazine concentrations. Trematode infections were high in
              metamorphs from all sites we sampled, but not associated with
              site triazine concentrations, except perhaps for a subset of
              sites sampled in both years. We detected triazines more often and
              in higher concentrations in breeding wetlands closer to corn
              production. Triazine concentrations increased in floodplain
              wetlands as water levels rose after rainfall and were similar
              among lotic and lentic sites. Overall, our results suggest
              amphibian populations were not faring differently among these
              four conservation areas, regardless of their proximity to corn
              production, and that the ecological dynamics of atrazine exposure

  abstract = "The influence of landscape matrix on functional connectivity has
              been clearly established. Now methods to assess the effects of
              different land uses on species' movements are needed because
              current methods are often biased. The use of physiological
              parameters as indicators of the level of resistance to animal
              movement associated with different land uses (i.e., matrix
              resistance) could provide estimates of energetic costs and risks
              to animals migrating through the matrix. To assess whether
              corticosterone levels indicate matrix resistance, we conducted
              experiments on substrate choice and measured levels of
              corticosterone before and after exposure of toads (Bufo bufo) to
              3 common substrates (ploughed soil, meadow, and forest litter).
              We expected matrix resistance and hormone levels to increase from
              forest litter (habitat of the toad) to meadows to ploughed soil.
              Adult toads had higher corticosterone levels on ploughed soil
              than on forest litter or meadow substrates. Hormone levels did
              not differ between forest litter and meadow. Toads avoided moving
              onto ploughed soil. Corticosterone levels in juvenile toads were
              not related to substrate type; however, hormone levels decreased
              as humidity increased. Juveniles, unlike adults, did not avoid
              moving over ploughed soil. The difference in responses between
              adult and juvenile toads may have been due to differences in
              experimental design (for juveniles, entire body used to measure
              corticosterone concentration; for adults, saliva alone);
              differences in the scale of sensory perception of the substrate
              (juveniles are much smaller than adults); or differences in
              cognitive processes between adult and juvenile toads. Adults
              probably had experience with different substrate types, whereas
              juveniles first emerging from the water probably did not. As a
              consequence, arable lands could act as ecological traps for
              juvenile toads.",

  abstract  = "The Global Amphibian Assessment, completed in 2004, revealed
               that over 32\% of the c. 6000 amphibian species known worldwide
               are threatened with extinction. This staggering figure exceeds
               rates of imperilment for both birds (12\%) and mammals (23\%).
               Amphibians face threats from traditional factors, such as
               habitat loss, unsustainable use, invasive species and pollution.
               These stresses are compounded by more novel threats, such as
               emerging infectious diseases and climate change, which are
               unimpeded by protected-area boundaries. A Summit was convened in
               September 2005 to devise a unified strategy for amphibian
               conservation in the form of the Amphibian Conservation Action
               Plan (ACAP; available at http://www.amphibians.org/). The ACAP
               outlines a 5 year plan to curtail the decline and extinction of
               amphibians, and focuses on 11 themes, each with an associated
               budget. The total estimated cost of abating the current trend
               comes to US \$400 million over the next 5 years. While this may
               appear daunting, it serves to highlight the urgency of the
               situation and draws attention to the need to steer limited
               resources towards the conservation of this vulnerable group. The
               ACAP is a call for help to governments, zoos and aquariums,
               civilians and researchers alike. We need to work together if we
               are going to succeed in stemming a mass extinction spasm
               affecting an entire class of vertebrates. The IUCN/SSC (The
               World Conservation Union/Species Survival Commission) Amphibian
               Specialist Group (ASG; http://www.amphibians.org/), formed after
               the Summit, is working to implement the ACAP by stimulating,
               developing and executing practical programmes to conserve
               amphibians and their habitats around the world. In addition, the
               ASG is supporting a global web of partners to develop funding,

               infection and mortality caused by Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis
               (Bd). We show that a `poor' (warmer) overwintering regime
               increases the probability of infection, supporting the concept
               that the dynamics of infection are altered by changing
               environmental temperature profiles. We also show once
               established, the proliferation of Bd in the host was better in
               toadlets that experienced a `good' (colder) winter. We find no
               relationship between survival and the different overwintering
               regimes or any consistent deleterious influence of disease on
               survival. Instead, survival is overwhelmingly predicted by
               measurements of condition (mass, mass lost over winter) that
               were not determined by overwintering temperature. We conclude
               that the survival of a cohort of overwintering toadlets is
               primarily driven by patterns of growth during the larval period
               rather than winter temperature or infectious disease.",

              decline in the near future, although the impact might vary
              geographically. We predicted that subtropical amphibians should
              be relatively susceptible to warming-induced extinctions because
              their upper critical thermal limits (CTmax) might be only
              slightly higher than maximum pond temperatures (Tmax). We tested
              this prediction by measuring CTmax and Tmax for 47 larval
              amphibian species from two thermally distinct subtropical
              communities (the warm community of the Gran Chaco and the cool
              community of Atlantic Forest, northern Argentina), as well as
              from one European temperate community. Upper thermal tolerances
              of tadpoles were positively correlated (controlling for

              steeper in subtropical than in temperate species. CTmax values

              warm community, which paradoxically, had very low warming
              tolerance (CTmax--Tmax) and therefore may be prone to future
              local extinction from acute thermal stress if rising pond Tmax
              soon exceeds their CTmax. Canopy-protected subtropical cool
              species have larger warming tolerance and thus should be less

               ecosystems but are threatened globally by many forms of human
               disturbance. Understanding the responses of wetland species to
               human disturbance is essential for effective wetland management
               and conservation. 2. We undertook a study to determine (i)
               whether anurans can be used effectively to assess the ecological
               integrity of wetlands affected by groundwater withdrawal and, if
               so, (ii) what effect increasing urbanization might have on the
               utility of anurans as wetland indicators. We monitored the
               intensity of anuran calls at 42 wetlands in south-western
               Florida throughout 2001--2002 and 2005--2009. 3. We first
               validated the use of anurans to assess wetland integrity using a
               small group of wetlands by comparing anuran calling and
               subsequent tadpole development with an established index
               employing vegetation composition and structure. We then verified
               that the results could be expanded to a variety of sites
               throughout the region. Finally, we focused on urbanized wetlands
               to determine whether urbanization could interfere with the use
               of anurans to assess wetland integrity. 4. We used PRESENCE to
               estimate occupancy and detection probabilities and to examine
               the relationship between occupancy and five covariates expected
               to influence individual species occurrence. We used FRAGSTATS to
               calculate the mean proximity index for urbanized wetlands, which
               assesses the size and distribution of land use types within a
               specified area. 5. Our results showed that the group of species
               including oak toad Anaxyrus quercicus, southern cricket frog
               Acris gryllus, pinewoods treefrog Hyla femoralis, barking
               treefrog Hyla gratiosa, and little grass frog Pseudacris
               ocularis is a reliable indicator of wetland integrity. However,
               this same group of species, which is sensitive to wetland
               health, is selectively excluded from urbanized wetlands. 6.
               Synthesis and applications. Although anurans are effective
               indicators of wetland health and complement vegetation surveys,
               the usefulness of this group for monitoring the ecological
               integrity of wetlands can be substantially reduced, or
               eliminated, as a consequence of urbanization. We urge for
               careful consideration of confounding factors in any studies

               mountain basins, including the remaining fishless lakes. We
               examined this relationship using the relative abundance of
               long-toed salamanders (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and Columbia
               spotted frogs (Rana luteiventris) in fish-containing and
               fishless lentic sites in basins with varying levels of historic
               fish stocking. All lentic waters were surveyed for fish and
               amphibians in 11 high-elevation basins in the Frank Church-River
               of No Return Wilderness, Idaho, between 1994 and 1999. We found
               introduced trout (Oncorhynchus clarki, O. mykiss, O. m.
               aguabonita) in 43 of the 101 sites, representing 90\% of the

               differences in habitat characteristics between fish-containing

               stages was significantly lower in lakes with fish. At the basin

               lower in the fishless sites of basins where more habitat was

               remaining fishless habitats are too shallow to provide suitable
               breeding or overwintering sites for these amphibians and that
               current trout distributions may eventually result in the
               extirpation of amphibian populations from entire landscapes,

              which causes the disease chytridiomycosis, has been associated
              with declines and extinctions of montane amphibians worldwide. To
              gain insight into factors affecting its distribution and
              prevalence we focus on the amphibian community of the Klamath
              Mountains in northwest California. The Cascades frog (Rana
              cascadae), one of the most common amphibians in these mountains,
              experienced increased mortality as a result of Bd exposure in
              laboratory trials and has experienced recent, dramatic declines
              in other parts of California. We surveyed 112 sites in the
              Klamaths, all of which supported R. cascadae between 1999 and
              2002, for amphibians and Bd to (1) determine the distribution of
              Bd, (2) evaluate changes in the distribution of R. cascadae, and
              (3) assess associations between potential biotic and abiotic
              drivers and Bd infection. Bd was widely distributed in the
              Klamath Mountains -- we detected the pathogen at 64\% of sites.
              R. cascadae was found at 79\% of sites, and was often infected
              with Bd. These results suggest that Bd has not caused dramatic
              declines in R. cascadae in the Klamaths in recent years. Subadult
              R. cascadae had a higher Bd prevalence than other R. cascadae
              life stages (subadults: 36\%, adults: 25\%, metamorphs: 4\%,
              larvae: 1\%), and while the probability of infection decreased
              over the season for adults, it did not for subadults, suggesting
              that subadults may be more vulnerable to chytridiomycosis than
              other R. cascadae life stages. Bd prevalence in R. cascadae was
              highest early in the season at high-elevation sites, which may
              indicate that populations inhabiting high elevation sites may
              have a greater risk of being affected by chytridiomycosis. Three
              other common amphibian species also tested positive for Bd:

              (resistance-resilience) in order to devise strategies to
              ameliorate this trend. We used a herpetofaunal assemblage to
              first assess spatial patterns of biodiversity and then to
              discover the underlying landscape processes likely responsible
              for these patterns. Reptiles and amphibians are a
              phylogenetically diverse set of species with documented
              sensitivity to environmental perturbations. We examined
              ecogeographic patterns of these taxa in aquatic and riparian
              environments across the landscape mosaic of the Mattole River
              watershed of northern California, USA. We analyzed species
              distributions relative to three primary vegetation types
              (grassland, second-growth forest, late-seral forest) and two
              hydrologic regimes (perennial vs intermittent). We sought
              evidence for the processes behind these patterns by modeling
              animal distributions relative to multi-scale compositional,
              structural, and physical attributes of the vegetation or
              hydrologic type. Total herpetofaunal diversity was higher along
              perennial streams, with reptile diversity higher in mixed
              grassland. Amphibian and reptile richness, and reptile evenness,
              varied significantly among the three vegetations. Evidence
              indicated that distinct assemblages were associated with each end
              of a seral continuum. Four amphibians were more abundant in
              late-seral forest, while two amphibians and two reptiles were
              more abundant in second-growth forest, or mixed grassland, or
              both. Two amphibians were more abundant along intermittent
              streams. Models for predicting reptile richness, or abundances of
              the two amphibian assemblages, indicated water temperature was
              the best predictor variable. Based on these results and the
              physiological limits of several sensitive species, we determined
              the primary processes influencing faunal assemblage patterns on

              viridescens. Recent studies have characterized chytridiomycosis
              as an emerging infectious disease, whose suspected rapid range
              expansion and widespread occurrence pose a significant risk for
              amphibian populations worldwide. We reared larvae in outdoor
              polyethylene experimental tanks and tested the effects of initial
              larval density, predator presence, and fungal exposure on Hyla
              recruitment and predator-prey interactions between Hyla and
              Notophthalmus. Newts reduced treefrog survival, and high
              intraspecific density decreased metamorphic body mass independent
              of B. dendrobatidis. The presence of fungi reduced treefrog body
              mass at metamorphosis by 34\%, but had no significant main effect
              on survival or larval period length. B. dendrobatidis
              differentially affected larval development in the presence of
              predators; Hyla developed slower when reared with the pathogen,
              but only when newts were present. This significant
              predator-by-pathogen interaction suggests that the impact of
              chytridiomycosis on larval amphibians may be exacerbated in
              complex communities. Our data suggest that B. dendrobatidis
              effects on host life history may be complex and indirect. Direct
              measurements of the community-level effects of pathogens offer an
              important opportunity to understand a significant threat to
              global biodiversity-declining amphibian populations.",

              Alteration of locomotor abilities by pollutants can also explain
              the difficulty of tadpoles to escape from predators. Here we
              assess the effects of a nitrogenous fertilizer on the response to
              predators shown by anuran tadpoles. In a first experiment, we
              chronically exposed Iberian painted frog (Discoglossus galganoi)
              and spadefoot toad (Pelobates cultripes) tadpoles to
              environmentally relevant concentrations of ammonium nitrate.
              After the exposure, we tested tadpoles' ability to avoid
              predation by the red crayfish (Procambarus clarkii). In a second
              experiment, we analysed the escape behaviour of P. cultripes
              tadpoles as a function of ammonium nitrate exposure and presence
              of predatory crayfishes. Tadpoles of both species that were
              exposed to ammonium nitrate were consumed by crayfishes faster

              N-NO(3)NH(4)/L=9.46 h). Control larval P. cultripes showed
              specific anti-predator escape responses, whereas those exposed to
              the fertilizer did not. We demonstrate, for the first time in
              amphibians, how nitrogenous fertilizers can affect larval
              defensive behaviours, and thereby increase the risk of predation.

              review",
  author   = "Hamer, Andrew J and McDonnell, Mark J",
  abstract = "Abstract Urbanisation currently threatens over one-third of the
              world's known amphibian species. The main threats of urbanisation
              to amphibian populations are habitat loss, habitat fragmentation
              and isolation, and degradation of habitat quality. A complex
              array of interacting biotic and abiotic factors impact amphibians
              in urban and urbanising landscapes. These can lead to a decrease
              in species richness and the abundance of individual species
              towards the centre of cities and towns. The ability of amphibians
              to disperse can be significantly reduced in urban and suburban
              landscapes. However, different species exhibit markedly different
              responses to urbanisation. Amphibian species that are habitat
              generalists or have relatively low dispersal requirements appear
              to be better able to survive in urban and suburban landscapes.
              There is insufficient information on the ecology of amphibians in
              urban and suburban areas, particularly in the tropics and
              sub-tropics, despite worldwide declines reported over past
              decades. Future research of amphibians in urban and suburban
              landscapes would greatly benefit by using long-term studies at
              sites along urban--rural gradients, conducted at both local and
              landscape scales. Research needs to be directed to the developing
              world in the tropics and sub-tropics, which has the highest rates
              of urbanisation. Research into amphibian ecology and conservation
              in the urbanising world would be improved through experimental
              approaches to determine the proximate causes of species'
              responses to human modification of the landscape. Maintaining
              viable populations of amphibians in urban and suburban landscapes
              will require conservation strategies that consider key
              urbanisation processes (i.e. habitat availability and habitat
              quality) and the key responses and adaptations to urbanisation
              (i.e. species availability and species response). Conservation
              strategies for amphibians in urban and suburban landscapes need
              to include actions to prevent further loss and degradation of
              both terrestrial and aquatic habitat, and to reconnect the
              landscape to facilitate dispersal and long-term regional
              persistence of amphibian populations and communities.",

               Across spatial scales, there was very little support for models
               with structural habitat features, such as tree canopy cover and
               conifer diameter. Model-averaged 95\% confidence intervals for
               regression coefficients and associated odds ratios indicated
               that the occurrence of Siskiyou Mountains salamanders was
               positively associated with rocky soils and Pacific madrone
               (Abutus menziesii) and negatively associated with elevation and
               white fir (Abies concolor); these associations were consistent

               salamanders by projecting habitat suitability scores across the

               applicable to selection of priority conservation areas for
               Siskiyou Mountains salamanders, and our approach can be easily

              scales. We assessed the breeding distribution of frogs in ponds
              along an urban-rural gradient in Greater Melbourne, Australia,
              and examined community relationships with habitat quality and
              landscape context. We sampled frog larvae at 65 ponds on four
              separate occasions and collected data on local pond and landscape
              variables. Using Bayesian Poisson regression modeling we found

              densities of human residents and at ponds with high water
              conductivity, whereas species richness increased substantially at

              introduction of nonnative fish into naturally fishless habitats.
              The objectives of the current study were to describe (1) the
              effect of fish removal from three lakes (located in two
              watersheds) on the small, remnant R. muscosa populations
              inhabiting those lakes, and (2) the initial development of
              metapopulation structure in each watershed as R. muscosa from
              expanding populations in fish-removal lakes dispersed to adjacent
              habitats. At all three fish-removal lakes, R. muscosa population
              densities increased significantly following the removal of
              predatory fish. The magnitude of these increases was
              significantly greater than that observed over the same time

  abstract  = "Abstract: Wind-borne pesticides have long been suggested as a
               cause of amphibian declines in areas without obvious habitat
               destruction. In California, the transport and deposition of
               pesticides from the agriculturally intensive Central Valley to
               the adjacent Sierra Nevada is well documented, and pesticides
               have been found in the bodies of Sierra frogs. Pesticides are
               therefore a plausible cause of declines, but to date no direct
               links have been found between pesticides and actual amphibian
               population declines. Using a geographic information system, we
               constructed maps of the spatial pattern of declines for eight
               declining California amphibian taxa, and compared the observed
               patterns of decline to those predicted by hypotheses of
               wind-borne pesticides, habitat destruction, ultraviolet
               radiation, and climate change. In four species, we found a
               strong positive association between declines and the amount of
               upwind agricultural land use, suggesting that wind-borne
               pesticides may be an important factor in declines. For two other
               species, declines were strongly associated with local urban and
               agricultural land use, consistent with the habitat-destruction
               hypothesis. The patterns of decline were not consistent with
               either the ultraviolet radiation or climate-change hypotheses
               for any of the species we examined.",

  author   = "Richter, B D and Braun, D P and Mendelson, M A and Master, L L",
  abstract = "Threats to imperiled freshwater fauna in the U.S. were assessed
              through an experts survey addressing anthropogenic stressors and
              their sources. Specifically, causes of historic declines and
              current limits to recovery were identified for 135 imperiled
              freshwater species of fishes, crayfishes, dragonflies and
              damselflies, mussels, and amphibians. The survey was designed to
              identify threats with sufficient specificity to inform resource
              managers and regulators faced with translating information about
              predominant biological threats into specific, responsive actions.
              The findings point to altered sediment loads and nutrient inputs
              from agricultural nonpoint pollution; interference from exotic
              species; and altered hydrologic regimes associated with
              impoundment operations as the three leading threats nationwide,
              accompanied by many lesser but still significant threats.
              Variations in threats among regions nad among taxa were also
              evident. Eastern species are most commonly affected by altered
              sediment loads from agricultural activities, whereas exotic
              species, habitat removal/damage, and altered hydrologic regimes
              predominate in the West. Altered sediment loading from
              agricultural activities and exotic species are dominant problems
              for both eastern mussels and fishes. However, eastern fishes also
              appear to be suffering from municipal nonpoint pollution
              (nutrients and sediments), whereas eastern mussels appear to be
              more severely affected by altered nutrient impacts from
              hydroelectric impoundments and agricultural runoff. Our findings
              suggest that control of nonpoint source pollution associated with
              agriculture activities should be a very high priority for
              agricultural producers and governmental support programs.
              Additionally, the large number of hydropower dams in the U.S.
              subject to federal re-licensing in coming years suggests a
              significant opportunity to restore natural hydrologic regimes in
              the affected rivers.",
